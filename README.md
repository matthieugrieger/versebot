## USAGE
### Making Verse Quotations
VerseBot is triggered by username mentions. Verse quotations are enclosed in brackets ([]), and may specify a desired translation within. A VerseBot quotation must follow one of the following formats (in each case the translation is optional):

```
[Book Chapter Translation]
[Book Chapter:Verse Translation]
[Book Chapter:StartVerse-EndVerse Translation]
```

More quotation formats will be implemented in the future.

### Editing/Deleting a VerseBot Comment
VerseBot comments can be easily edited or deleted by clicking on the "edit" or "delete" links that can be found at the bottom of every VerseBot comment. Only the user who triggered the VerseBot response can edit or delete the comment.

### Setting a Default Translation
A default translation is the translation VerseBot defaults to for a particular user or subreddit. This means that a user/subreddit can specify a default translation, and the user(s) do not need to place the abbreviation for the translation within their comment.

Translation defaults are prioritized in the following order:

1) User Translation

2) Subreddit Translation

3) VerseBot Translation

Default translations can be set by visiting the [Default Translations section](http://matthieugrieger/versebot/#defaults) of the VerseBot website.

There are two types of default translations that can be set:

1) *User Translations* -- A set of default translations for a reddit user. Note that user default translations that have not been used for 90 days or more will be deleted to save on database storage space.

2) *Subreddit Translations* -- A set of default translations for a subreddit. This type of default translation **must** be set by a moderator of the subreddit, otherwise VerseBot will simply ignore the request. Subreddit default translations never expire.
