VWhen I bring clouds over the earth, and the bow appears in the clouds,

sI15
VI will remember My covenant between Me and you and every living creature among all flesh, so that the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
p234
sI16
VWhen the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures, all flesh that is on earth.

VBut Abimelech said, \u201cI do not know who did this; you did not tell me, nor have I heard of it until today.\u201d

VAbraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a pact.

p575
sI2
VAnd He said, \u201cTake your son, your favored one, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the heights that I will point out to you.\u201d
p576

VSo early next morning, Abraham saddled his ass and took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and he set out for the place of which God had told him.

VOn the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place from afar.

VAbraham took the wood for the burnt offering and put it on his son Isaac. He himself took the firestone and the knife; and the two walked off together.

VThey arrived at the place of which God had told him. Abraham built an altar there; he laid out the wood; he bound his son Isaac; he laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
p583

VAnd Abraham picked up the knife to slay his son.
p584

VAnd he said, \u201cDo not raise your hand against the boy, or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your favored one, from Me.\u201d
p586

VWhen Abraham looked up, his eye fell upon a ram, caught in the thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering in place of his son.

sI4
V\u201cI am a resident alien among you; sell me a burial site among you, that I may remove my dead for burial.\u201d

VEphron was present among the Hittites; so Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, all who entered the gate of his town, saying,
p609
sI11
V\u201cNo, my lord, hear me: I give you the field and I give you the cave that is in it; I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.\u201d
p610
sI12
VThen Abraham bowed low before the people of the land,
p611
sI13
Vand spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, \u201cIf only you would hear me out! Let me pay the price of the land; accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there.\u201d
p612
sI14
VAnd Ephron replied to Abraham, saying to him,
p613
sI15
V\u201cMy lord, do hear me! A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver\u2014what is that between you and me? Go and bury your dead.\u201d
p614
sI16
VAbraham accepted Ephron\u2019s terms. Abraham paid out to Ephron the money that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites\u2014four hundred shekels of silver at the going merchants\u2019 rate.
p615
sI17
VSo Ephron\u2019s land in Machpelah, near Mamre\u2014the field with its cave and all the trees anywhere within the confines of that field\u2014passed
p616

Vto Abraham as his possession, in the presence of the Hittites, of all who entered the gate of his town.

VAbraham answered him, \u201cOn no account must you take my son back there!
p626
sI7
VThe Lord, the God of heaven, who took me from my father\u2019s house and from my native land, who promised me on oath, saying, \u2018I will assign this land to your offspring\u2019\u2014He will send His angel before you, and you will get a wife for my son from there.

VSo the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore to him as bidden.

VThen the servant took ten of his master\u2019s camels and set out, taking with him all the bounty of his master; and he made his way to Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor.
p630
sI11
VHe made the camels kneel down by the well outside the city, at evening time, the time when women come out to draw water.
p631
sI12
VAnd he said, \u201cO Lord, God of my master Abraham, grant me good fortune this day, and deal graciously with my master Abraham:

VHere I stand by the spring as the daughters of the townsmen come out to draw water;

VThe maiden was very beautiful, a virgin whom no man had known. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.

VQuickly emptying her jar into the trough, she ran back to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels.
p640
sI21
VThe man, meanwhile, stood gazing at her, silently wondering whether the Lord had made his errand successful or not.
p641
sI22
VWhen the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold nose-ring weighing a half-shekel, and two gold bands for her arms, ten shekels in weight.
p642
sI23
V\u201cPray tell me,\u201d he said, \u201cwhose daughter are you? Is there room in your father\u2019s house for us to spend the night?\u201d

VShe replied, \u201cI am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.\u201d

VAnd she went on, \u201cThere is plenty of straw and feed at home, and also room to spend the night.\u201d

sI26
VThe man bowed low in homage to the Lord
p646

p647
sI28
VThe maiden ran and told all this to her mother\u2019s household.

VSo the man entered the house, and the camels were unloaded. The camels were given straw and feed, and water was brought to bathe his feet and the feet of the men with him.
p652

VBut when food was set before him, he said, \u201cI will not eat until I have told my tale.\u201d He said, \u201cSpeak, then.\u201d

V\u201cI am Abraham\u2019s servant,\u201d he began.

V\u201cI came today to the spring, and I said: O Lord, God of my master Abraham, if You would indeed grant success to the errand on which I am engaged!

VI had scarcely finished praying in my heart, when Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder, and went down to the spring and drew. And I said to her, \u2018Please give me a drink.\u2019
p665
sI46
VShe quickly lowered her jar and said, \u2018Drink, and I will also water your camels.\u2019 So I drank, and she also watered the camels.
p666
sI47
VI inquired of her, \u2018Whose daughter are you?\u2019 And she said, \u2018The daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.\u2019 And I put the ring on her nose and the bands on her arms.
p667
sI48
VThen I bowed low in homage to the Lord and blessed the Lord,  the God of my master Abraham, who led me on the right way to get the daughter of my master\u2019s brother for his son.

VAnd now, if you mean to treat my master with true kindness, tell me; and if not, tell me also, that I may turn right or left.\u201d

VThe servant brought out objects of silver and gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; and he gave presents to her brother and her mother.
p673

VThen he and the men with him ate and drank, and they spent the night. When they arose next morning, he said, \u201cGive me leave to go to my master.\u201d
p674
sI55
VBut her brother and her mother said, \u201cLet the maiden remain with us some ten days; then you may go.\u201d

VHe said to them, \u201cDo not delay me, now that the Lord has made my errand successful. Give me leave that I may go to my master.\u201d

VIsaac had just come back from the vicinity of Beer-lahai-roi, for he was settled in the region of the Negeb.

VI will make your heirs as numerous as the stars of heaven, and assign to your heirs all these lands, so that all the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by your heirs\u2014
p727

Vinasmuch as Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge: My commandments, My laws, and My teachings.\u201d
p728
sI6
VSo Isaac stayed in Gerar.
p729
sI7
VWhen the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, \u201cShe is my sister,\u201d for he was afraid to say \u201cmy wife,\u201d thinking, \u201cThe men of the place might kill me on account of Rebekah, for she is beautiful.\u201d
p730
sI8
VWhen some time had passed, Abimelech king of the Philistines, looking out of the window, saw Isaac fondling his wife Rebekah.
p731
sI9
VAbimelech sent for Isaac and said, \u201cSo she is your wife! Why then did you say: \u2018She is my sister?\u201d\u2018 Isaac said to him, \u201cBecause I thought I might lose my life on account of her.\u201d
p732
sI10
VAbimelech said, \u201cWhat have you done to us! One of the people might have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.\u201d
p733
sI11
VAbimelech then charged all the people, saying, \u201cAnyone who molests this man or his wife shall be put to death.\u201d
p734
sI12
VIsaac sowed in that land and reaped a hundredfold the same year. The Lord blessed him,
p735
sI13
Vand the man grew richer and richer until he was very wealthy:
p736
sI14
Vhe acquired flocks and herds, and a large household, so that the Philistines envied him.
p737
sI15
VAnd the Philistines stopped up all the wells which his father\u2019s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham, filling them with earth.
p738
sI16
VAnd Abimelech said to Isaac, \u201cGo away from us, for you have become far too big for us.\u201d
p739
sI17
VSo Isaac departed from there and encamped in the wadi of Gerar, where he settled.
p740
sI18
VIsaac dug anew the wells which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham and which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham\u2019s death; and he gave them the same names that his father had given them.
p741
sI19
VBut when Isaac\u2019s servants, digging in the wadi, found there a well of spring water,
p742
sI20
Vthe herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac\u2019s herdsmen, saying, \u201cThe water is ours.\u201d He named that well Esek, because they contended with him.
p743
sI21
VAnd when they dug another well, they disputed over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.
p744
sI22
VHe moved from there and dug yet another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he called it Rehoboth, saying, \u201cNow at last the Lord has granted us ample space to increase in the land.\u201d
p745
sI23
VFrom there he went up to Beer-sheba.
p746
sI24
VThat night the Lord appeared to him and said, \u201cI am the God of your father Abraham. Fear not, for I am with you, and I will bless you and increase your offspring for the sake of My servant Abraham.\u201d
p747
sI25
VSo he built an altar there and invoked the Lord by name. Isaac pitched his tent there and his servants started digging a well.
p748
sI26
VAnd Abimelech came to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his councilor and Phicol chief of his troops.
p749
sI27
VIsaac said to them, \u201cWhy have you come to me, seeing that you have been hostile to me and have driven me away from you?\u201d
p750
sI28
VAnd they said, \u201cWe now see plainly that the Lord has been with you, and we thought: Let there be a sworn treaty between our two parties, between you and us. Let us make a pact with you
p751
sI29
Vthat you will not do us harm, just as we have not molested you but have always dealt kindly with you and sent you away in peace. From now on, be you blessed of the Lord!\u201d
p752
sI30
VThen he made for them a feast, and they ate and drank.
p753
sI31
VEarly in the morning, they exchanged oaths. Isaac then bade them farewell, and they departed from him in peace.
p754
sI32
VThat same day Isaac\u2019s servants came and told him about the well they had dug, and said to him, \u201cWe have found water!\u201d
p755
sI33
VHe named it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.
p756
sI34
VWhen Esau was forty years old, he took to wife Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite;

VWhen Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, he called his older son Esau and said to him, \u201cMy son.\u201d He answered, \u201cHere I am.\u201d
p760
sI2
VAnd he said, \u201cI am old now, and I do not know how soon I may die.
p761
sI3
VTake your gear, your quiver and bow, and go out into the open and hunt me some game.
p762
sI4
VThen prepare a dish for me such as I like, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my innermost blessing before I die.\u201d
p763
sI5
VRebekah had been listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau had gone out into the open to hunt game to bring home,
p764
sI6
VRebekah said to her son Jacob, \u201cI overheard your father speaking to your brother Esau, saying,
p765
sI7
V\u2018Bring me some game and prepare a dish for me to eat, that I may bless you, with the Lord\u2018s approval, before I die.\u2019
p766
sI8
VNow, my son, listen carefully as I instruct you.
p767
sI9
VGo to the flock and fetch me two choice kids, and I will make of them a dish for your father, such as he likes.
p768
sI10
VThen take it to your father to eat, in order that he may bless you before he dies.\u201d
p769
sI11
VJacob answered his mother Rebekah, \u201cBut my brother Esau is a hairy man and I am smooth-skinned.
p770
sI12
VIf my father touches me, I shall appear to him as a trickster and bring upon myself a curse, not a blessing.\u201d
p771
sI13
VBut his mother said to him, \u201cYour curse, my son, be upon me! Just do as I say and go fetch them for me.\u201d
p772
sI14
VHe got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared a dish such as his father liked.
p773
sI15
VRebekah then took the best clothes of her older son Esau, which were there in the house, and had her younger son Jacob put them on;
p774
sI16
Vand she covered his hands and the hairless part of his neck with the skins of the kids.
p775
sI17
VThen she put in the hands of her son Jacob the dish and the bread that she had prepared.
p776
sI18
VHe went to his father and said, \u201cFather.\u201d And he said, \u201cYes, which of my sons are you?\u201d
p777
sI19
VJacob said to his father, \u201cI am Esau, your first-born; I have done as you told me. Pray sit up and eat of my game, that you may give me your innermost blessing.\u201d
p778
sI20
VIsaac said to his son, \u201cHow did you succeed so quickly, my son?\u201d And he said, \u201cBecause the Lord your God granted me good fortune.\u201d
p779
sI21
VIsaac said to Jacob, \u201cCome closer that I may feel you, my son\u2014whether you are really my son Esau or not.\u201d
p780
sI22
VSo Jacob drew close to his father Isaac, who felt him and wondered. \u201cThe voice is the voice of Jacob, yet the hands are the hands of Esau.\u201d
p781
sI23
VHe did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; and so he blessed him.
p782
sI24
VHe asked, \u201cAre you really my son Esau?\u201d And when he said, \u201cI am,\u201d
p783
sI25
Vhe said, \u201cServe me and let me eat of my son\u2019s game that I may give you my innermost blessing.\u201d So he served him and he ate, and he brought him wine and he drank.
p784
sI26
VThen his father Isaac said to him, \u201cCome close and kiss me, my son\u201d;
p785
sI27
Vand he went up and kissed him. And he smelled his clothes and he blessed him, saying, \u201cAh, the smell of my son is like the smell of the fields that the Lord has blessed.
p786
sI28
V\u201cMay God give youOf the dew of heaven and the fat of the earth,Abundance of new grain and wine.
p787
sI29
VLet peoples serve you,And nations bow to you;Be master over your brothers,And let your mother\u2019s sons bow to you.Cursed be they who curse you,Blessed they who bless you.\u201d
p788
sI30
VNo sooner had Jacob left the presence of his father Isaac\u2014after Isaac had finished blessing Jacob\u2014than his brother Esau came back from his hunt.
p789
sI31
VHe too prepared a dish and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, \u201cLet my father sit up and eat of his son\u2019s game, so that you may give me your innermost blessing.\u201d
p790
sI32
VHis father Isaac said to him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d And he said, \u201cI am your son, Esau, your first-born!\u201d
p791
sI33
VIsaac was seized with very violent trembling. \u201cWho was it then,\u201d he demanded, \u201cthat hunted game and brought it to me? Moreover, I ate of it before you came, and I blessed him; now he must remain blessed!\u201d
p792
sI34
VWhen Esau heard his father\u2019s words, he burst into wild and bitter sobbing, and said to his father, \u201cBless me too, Father!\u201d
p793
sI35
VBut he answered, \u201cYour brother came with guile and took away your blessing.\u201d
p794
sI36
V[Esau] said, \u201cWas he, then, named Jacob that he might supplant me these two times? First he took away my birthright and now he has taken away my blessing!\u201d And he added, \u201cHave you not reserved a blessing for me?\u201d
p795
sI37
VIsaac answered, saying to Esau, \u201cBut I have made him master over you: I have given him all his brothers for servants, and sustained him with grain and wine. What, then, can I still do for you, my son?\u201d
p796
sI38
VAnd Esau said to his father, \u201cHave you but one blessing, Father? Bless me too, Father!\u201d And Esau wept aloud.
p797
sI39
VAnd his father Isaac answered, saying to him,\u201cSee, your abode shall enjoy the fat of the earthAnd the dew of heaven above.
p798
sI40
VYet by your sword you shall live,And you shall serve your brother;But when you grow restive,You shall break his yoke from your neck.\u201d
p799
sI41
VNow Esau harbored a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing which his father had given him, and Esau said to himself, \u201cLet but the mourning period of my father come, and I will kill my brother Jacob.\u201d
p800
sI42
VWhen the words of her older son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, \u201cYour brother Esau is consoling himself by planning to kill you.
p801
sI43
VNow, my son, listen to me. Flee at once to Haran, to my brother Laban.
p802
sI44
VStay with him a while, until your brother\u2019s fury subsides\u2014
p803
sI45
Vuntil your brother\u2019s anger against you subsides\u2014and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will fetch you from there. Let me not lose you both in one day!\u201d
p804
sI46
VRebekah said to Isaac, \u201cI am disgusted with my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries a Hittite woman like these, from among the native women, what good will life be to me?\u201d
p805
ssI28
(dp806
I1
VSo Isaac sent for Jacob and blessed him. He instructed him, saying, \u201cYou shall not take a wife from among the Canaanite women.
p807
sI2
VUp, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother\u2019s father, and take a wife there from among the daughters of Laban, your mother\u2019s brother,
p808
sI3
VMay El Shaddai bless you, make you fertile and numerous, so that you become an assembly of peoples.
p809
sI4
VMay He grant the blessing of Abraham to you and your offspring, that you may possess the land where you are sojourning, which God assigned to Abraham.\u201d
p810
sI5
VThen Isaac sent Jacob off, and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, mother of Jacob and Esau.
p811
sI6
VWhen Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him off to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, charging him, as he blessed him, \u201cYou shall not take a wife from among the Canaanite women,\u201d
p812
sI7
Vand that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and gone to Paddan-aram,
p813
sI8
VEsau realized that the Canaanite women displeased his father Isaac.
p814
sI9
VSo Esau went to Ishmael and took to wife, in addition to the wives he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, sister of Nebaioth.\u05d5\u05d9\u05e6\u05d0
p815
sI10
VJacob left Beer-sheba, and set out for Haran.
p816
sI11
VHe came upon a certain place and stopped there for the night, for the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of that place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place.
p817
sI12
VHe had a dream; a stairway was set on the ground and its top reached to the sky, and angels of God were going up and down on it.
p818
sI13
VAnd the Lord was standing beside him and He said, \u201cI am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac: the ground on which you are lying I will assign to you and to your offspring.
p819
sI14
VYour descendants shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All the families of the earth shall bless themselves by you and your descendants.
p820
sI15
VRemember, I am with you: I will protect you wherever you go and will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.\u201d
p821
sI16
VJacob awoke from his sleep and said, \u201cSurely the Lord is present in this place, and I did not know it!\u201d
p822
sI17
VShaken, he said, \u201cHow awesome is this place! This is none other than the abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven.\u201d
p823
sI18
VEarly in the morning, Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.
p824
sI19
VHe named that site Bethel; but previously the name of the city had been Luz.
p825
sI20
VJacob then made a vow, saying, \u201cIf God remains with me, if He protects me on this journey that I am making, and gives me bread to eat and clothing to wear,
p826
sI21
Vand if I return safe to my father\u2019s house\u2014the Lord shall be my God.
p827
sI22
VAnd this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, shall be God\u2019s abode; and of all that You give me, I will set aside a tithe for You.\u201d
p828
ssI29
(dp829
I1
VJacob resumed his journey and came to the land of the Easterners.
p830
sI2
VThere before his eyes was a well in the open. Three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it, for the flocks were watered from that well. The stone on the mouth of the well was large.
p831
sI3
VWhen all the flocks were gathered there, the stone would be rolled from the mouth of the well and the sheep watered; then the stone would be put back in its place on the mouth of the well.
p832
sI4
VJacob said to them, \u201cMy friends, where are you from?\u201d And they said, \u201cWe are from Haran.\u201d
p833
sI5
VHe said to them, \u201cDo you know Laban the son of Nahor?\u201d And they said, \u201cYes, we do.\u201d
p834
sI6
VHe continued, \u201cIs he well?\u201d They answered, \u201cYes, he is; and there is his daughter Rachel, coming with the flock.\u201d
p835
sI7
VHe said, \u201cIt is still broad daylight, too early to round up the animals; water the flock and take them to pasture.\u201d
p836
sI8
VBut they said, \u201cWe cannot, until all the flocks are rounded up; then the stone is rolled off the mouth of the well and we water the sheep.\u201d
p837
sI9
VWhile he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father\u2019s flock; for she was a shepherdess.
p838
sI10
VAnd when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his uncle Laban, and the flock of his uncle Laban, Jacob went up and rolled the stone off the mouth of the well, and watered the flock of his uncle Laban.
p839
sI11
VThen Jacob kissed Rachel, and broke into tears.
p840
sI12
VJacob told Rachel that he was her father\u2019s kinsman, that he was Rebekah\u2019s son; and she ran and told her father.
p841
sI13
VOn hearing the news of his sister\u2019s son Jacob, Laban ran to greet him; he embraced him and kissed him, and took him into his house. He told Laban all that had happened,
p842
sI14
Vand Laban said to him, \u201cYou are truly my bone and flesh.\u201dWhen he had stayed with him a month\u2019s time,
p843
sI15
VLaban said to Jacob, \u201cJust because you are a kinsman, should you serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?\u201d
p844
sI16
VNow Laban had two daughters; the name of the older one was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
p845
sI17
VLeah had weak eyes; Rachel was shapely and beautiful.
p846
sI18
VJacob loved Rachel; so he answered, \u201cI will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.\u201d
p847
sI19
VLaban said, \u201cBetter that I give her to you than that I should give her to an outsider. Stay with me.\u201d
p848
sI20
VSo Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed to him but a few days because of his love for her.
p849
sI21
VThen Jacob said to Laban, \u201cGive me my wife, for my time is fulfilled, that I may cohabit with her.\u201d
p850
sI22
VAnd Laban gathered all the people of the place and made a feast.
p851
sI23
VWhen evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to him; and he cohabited with her.\u2014
p852
sI24
VLaban had given his maidservant Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maid.\u2014
p853
sI25
VWhen morning came, there was Leah! So he said to Laban, \u201cWhat is this you have done to me? I was in your service for Rachel! Why did you deceive me?\u201d
p854
sI26
VLaban said, \u201cIt is not the practice in our place to marry off the younger before the older.
p855
sI27
VWait until the bridal week of this one is over and we will give you that one too, provided you serve me another seven years.\u201d
p856
sI28
VJacob did so; he waited out the bridal week of the one, and then he gave him his daughter Rachel as wife.\u2014
p857
sI29
VLaban had given his maidservant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maid.\u2014
p858
sI30
VAnd Jacob cohabited with Rachel also; indeed, he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served him another seven years.
p859
sI31
VThe Lord saw that Leah was unloved and he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.
p860
sI32
VLeah conceived and bore a son, and named him Reuben; for she declared, \u201cIt means: \u2018The Lord has seen my affliction\u2019; it also means: \u2018Now my husband will love me.\u201d\u2018
p861
sI33
VShe conceived again and bore a son, and declared, \u201cThis is because the Lord heard that I was unloved and has given me this one also\u201d; so she named him Simeon.
p862
sI34
VAgain she conceived and bore a son and declared, \u201cThis time my husband will become attached to me, for I have borne him three sons.\u201d Therefore he was named Levi.
p863
sI35
VShe conceived again and bore a son, and declared, \u201cThis time I will praise the Lord.\u201d Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.

VJacob was incensed at Rachel, and said, \u201cCan I take the place of God, who has denied you fruit of the womb?\u201d

sI3
VShe said, \u201cHere is my maid Bilhah. Consort with her, that she may bear on my knees and that through her I too may have children.\u201d

VSo she gave him her maid Bilhah as concubine, and Jacob cohabited with her.
p869
sI5
VBilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.

VAnd Rachel said, \u201cGod has vindicated me; indeed, He has heeded my plea and given me a son.\u201d Therefore she named him Dan.

VRachel\u2019s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.

p873
sI9
VWhen Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as concubine.
p874
sI10
VAnd when Leah\u2019s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son,

VLeah said, \u201cWhat luck!\u201d So she named him Gad.
p876

VWhen Leah\u2019s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son,
p877

VLeah declared, \u201cWhat fortune!\u201d meaning, \u201cWomen will deem me fortunate.\u201d So she named him Asher.
p878
sI14
VOnce, at the time of the wheat harvest, Reuben came upon some mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, \u201cPlease give me some of your son\u2019s mandrakes.\u201d
p879
sI15
VBut she said to her, \u201cWas it not enough for you to take away my husband, that you would also take my son\u2019s mandrakes?\u201d Rachel replied, \u201cI promise, he shall lie with you tonight, in return for your son\u2019s mandrakes.\u201d
p880
sI16
VWhen Jacob came home from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, \u201cYou are to sleep with me, for I have hired you with my son\u2019s mandrakes.\u201d And he lay with her that night.
p881
sI17
VGod heeded Leah, and she conceived and bore him a fifth son.
p882
sI18
VAnd Leah said, \u201cGod has given me my reward for having given my maid to my husband.\u201d So she named him Issachar.
p883
sI19
VWhen Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son,
p884
sI20
VLeah said, \u201cGod has given me a choice gift; this time my husband will exalt me, for I have borne him six sons.\u201d So she named him Zebulun.
p885
sI21
VLast, she bore him a daughter, and named her Dinah.
p886
sI22
VNow God remembered Rachel; God heeded her and opened her womb.
p887
sI23
VShe conceived and bore a son, and said, \u201cGod has taken away my disgrace.\u201d
p888

VAfter Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, \u201cGive me leave to go back to my own homeland.

VBut Laban said to him, \u201cIf you will indulge me, I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me on your account.\u201d
p892
sI28
VAnd he continued, \u201cName the wages due from me, and I will pay you.\u201d
p893
sI29
VBut he said, \u201cYou know well how I have served you and how your livestock has fared with me.
p894
sI30
VFor the little you had before I came has grown to much, since the Lord has blessed you wherever I turned. And now, when shall I make provision for my own household?\u201d
p895
sI31
VHe said, \u201cWhat shall I pay you?\u201d And Jacob said, \u201cPay me nothing! If you will do this thing for me, I will again pasture and keep your flocks:
p896
sI32
Vlet me pass through your whole flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted animal\u2014every dark-colored sheep and every spotted and speckled goat. Such shall be my wages.
p897
sI33
VIn the future when you go over my wages, let my honesty toward you testify for me: if there are among my goats any that are not speckled or spotted or any sheep that are not dark-colored, they got there by theft.\u201d
p898
sI34
VAnd Laban said, \u201cVery well, let it be as you say.\u201d
p899
sI35
VBut that same day he removed the streaked and spotted he-goats and all the speckled and spotted she-goats\u2014every one that had white on it\u2014and all the dark-colored sheep, and left them in the charge of his sons.
p900
sI36
VAnd he put a distance of three days\u2019 journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob was pasturing the rest of Laban\u2019s flock.
p901
sI37
VJacob then got fresh shoots of poplar, and of almond and plane, and peeled white stripes in them, laying bare the white of the shoots.
p902
sI38
VThe rods that he had peeled he set up in front of the goats in the troughs, the water receptacles, that the goats came to drink from. Their mating occurred when they came to drink,
p903
sI39
Vand since the goats mated by the rods, the goats brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted young.
p904
sI40
VBut Jacob dealt separately with the sheep; he made these animals face the streaked or wholly dark-colored animals in Laban\u2019s flock. And so he produced special flocks for himself, which he did not put with Laban\u2019s flocks.
p905
sI41
VMoreover, when the sturdier animals were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the troughs, in full view of the animals, so that they mated by the rods;
p906
sI42
Vbut with the feebler animals he would not place them there. Thus the feeble ones went to Laban and the sturdy to Jacob.
p907
sI43
VSo the man grew exceedingly prosperous, and came to own large flocks, maidservants and menservants, camels and asses.
p908
ssI31
(dp909

VNow he heard the things that Laban\u2019s sons were saying: \u201cJacob has taken all that was our father\u2019s, and from that which was our father\u2019s he has built up all this wealth.\u201d
p910
sI2
VJacob also saw that Laban\u2019s manner toward him was not as it had been in the past.
p911
sI3
VThen the Lord said to Jacob, \u201cReturn to the land of your fathers where you were born, and I will be with you.\u201d
p912
sI4
VJacob had Rachel and Leah called to the field, where his flock was,
p913
sI5
Vand said to them, \u201cI see that your father\u2019s manner toward me is not as it has been in the past. But the God of my father has been with me.
p914
sI6
VAs you know, I have served your father with all my might;
p915
sI7
Vbut your father has cheated me, changing my wages time and again. God, however, would not let him do me harm.
p916
sI8
VIf he said thus, \u2018The speckled shall be your wages,\u2019 then all the flocks would drop speckled young; and if he said thus, \u2018The streaked shall be your wages,\u2019 then all the flocks would drop streaked young.
p917
sI9
VGod has taken away your father\u2019s livestock and given it to me.
p918
sI10
V\u201cOnce, at the mating time of the flocks, I had a dream in which I saw that the he-goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled, and mottled.
p919
sI11
VAnd in the dream an angel of God said to me, \u2018Jacob!\u2019 \u2018Here,\u2019 I answered.
p920
sI12
VAnd he said, \u2018Note well that all the he-goats which are mating with the flock are streaked, speckled, and mottled; for I have noted all that Laban has been doing to you.
p921
sI13
VI am the God of Beth-el, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to Me. Now, arise and leave this land and return to your native land.\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p922
sI14
VThen Rachel and Leah answered him, saying, \u201cHave we still a share in the inheritance of our father\u2019s house?
p923
sI15
VSurely, he regards us as outsiders, now that he has sold us and has used up our purchase price.
p924
sI16
VTruly, all the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. Now then, do just as God has told you.\u201d
p925
sI17
VThereupon Jacob put his children and wives on camels;
p926
sI18
Vand he drove off all his livestock and all the wealth that he had amassed, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.
p927
sI19
VMeanwhile Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father\u2019s household idols.
p928
sI20
VJacob kept Laban the Aramean in the dark, not telling him that he was fleeing,
p929
sI21
Vand fled with all that he had. Soon he was across the Euphrates and heading toward the hill country of Gilead.
p930
sI22
VOn the third day, Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
p931
sI23
VSo he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him a distance of seven days, catching up with him in the hill country of Gilead.
p932
sI24
VBut God appeared to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night and said to him, \u201cBeware of attempting anything with Jacob, good or bad.\u201d
p933
sI25
VLaban overtook Jacob. Jacob had pitched his tent on the Height, and Laban with his kinsmen encamped in the hill country of Gilead.
p934
sI26
VAnd Laban said to Jacob, \u201cWhat did you mean by keeping me in the dark and carrying off my daughters like captives of the sword?
p935
sI27
VWhy did you flee in secrecy and mislead me and not tell me? I would have sent you off with festive music, with timbrel and lyre.
p936
sI28
VYou did not even let me kiss my sons and daughters good-by! It was a foolish thing for you to do.
p937
sI29
VI have it in my power to do you harm; but the God of your father said to me last night, \u2018Beware of attempting anything with Jacob, good or bad.\u2019
p938
sI30
VVery well, you had to leave because you were longing for your father\u2019s house; but why did you steal my gods?
p939
sI31
VJacob answered Laban, saying, \u201cI was afraid because I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.
p940
sI32
VBut anyone with whom you find your gods shall not remain alive! In the presence of our kinsmen, point out what I have of yours and take it.\u201d Jacob, of course, did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
p941
sI33
VSo Laban went into Jacob\u2019s tent and Leah\u2019s tent and the tents of the two maidservants; but he did not find them. Leaving Leah\u2019s tent, he entered Rachel\u2019s tent.
p942
sI34
VRachel, meanwhile, had taken the idols and placed them in the camel cushion and sat on them; and Laban rummaged through the tent without finding them.
p943
sI35
VFor she said to her father, \u201cLet not my lord take it amiss that I cannot rise before you, for the period of women is upon me.\u201d Thus he searched, but could not find the household idols.
p944
sI36
VNow Jacob  became incensed and took up his grievance with Laban. Jacob spoke up and said to Laban, \u201cWhat is my crime, what is my guilt that you should pursue me?
p945
sI37
VYou rummaged through all my things; what have you found of all your household objects? Set it here, before my kinsmen and yours, and let them decide between us two.
p946
sI38
V\u201cThese twenty years I have spent in your service, your ewes and she-goats never miscarried, nor did I feast on rams from your flock.
p947
sI39
VThat which was torn by beasts I never brought to you; I myself made good the loss; you exacted it of me, whether snatched by day or snatched by night.
p948
sI40
VOften, scorching heat ravaged me by day and frost by night; and sleep fled from my eyes.
p949
sI41
VOf the twenty years that I spent in your household, I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flocks; and you changed my wages time and again.
p950
sI42
VHad not the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, been with me, you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God took notice of my plight and the toil of my hands, and He gave judgment last night.\u201d
p951
sI43
VThen Laban spoke up and said to Jacob, \u201cThe daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks; all that you see is mine. Yet what can I do now about my daughters or the children they have borne?
p952
sI44
VCome, then, let us make a pact, you and I, that there may be a witness between you and me.\u201d
p953
sI45
VThereupon Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
p954
sI46
VAnd Jacob said to his kinsmen, \u201cGather stones.\u201d So they took stones and made a mound; and they partook of a meal there by the mound.
p955
sI47
VLaban named it Yegar-sahadutha, but Jacob named it Gal-ed.
p956
sI48
VAnd Laban declared, \u201cThis mound is a witness between you and me this day.\u201d That is why it was named Gal-ed;
p957
sI49
VAnd [it was called] Mizpah, because he said, \u201cMay the Lord watch between you and me, when we are out of sight of each other.
p958
sI50
VIf you ill-treat my daughters or take other wives besides my daughters\u2014though no one else be about, remember, God Himself will be witness between you and me.\u201d
p959
sI51
VAnd Laban said to Jacob, \u201cHere is this mound and here the pillar which I have set up between you and me:
p960
sI52
Vthis mound shall be witness and this pillar shall be witness that I am not to cross to you past this mound, and that you are not to cross to me past this mound and this pillar, with hostile intent.
p961
sI53
VMay the God of Abraham and the god of Nahor\u201d\u2014their ancestral deities\u2014\u201cjudge between us.\u201d And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.
p962
sI54
VJacob then offered up a sacrifice on the Height, and invited his kinsmen to partake of the meal. After the meal, they spent the night on the Height.

(dp964

VEarly in the morning, Laban kissed his sons and daughters and bade them good-by; then Laban left on his journey homeward.
p965
sI2
VJacob went on his way, and angels of God encountered him.
p966
sI3
VWhen he saw them, Jacob said, \u201cThis is God\u2019s camp.\u201d So he named that place Mahanaim.\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05dc\u05d7
p967
sI4
VJacob sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom,
p968
sI5
Vand instructed them as follows, \u201dThus shall you say, \u2018To my lord Esau, thus says your servant Jacob: I stayed with Laban and remained until now;
p969
sI6
VI have acquired cattle, asses, sheep, and male and female slaves; and I send this message to my lord in the hope of gaining your favor.\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p970
sI7
VThe messengers returned to Jacob, saying, \u201cWe came to your brother Esau; he himself is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him.\u201d
p971
sI8
VJacob was greatly frightened; in his anxiety, he divided the people with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps,
p972
sI9
Vthinking, \u201cIf Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, the other camp may yet escape.\u201d
p973
sI10
VThen Jacob said, \u201cO God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, who said to me, \u2018Return to your native land and I will deal bountifully with you\u2019!
p974
sI11
VI am unworthy of all the kindness that You have so steadfastly shown Your servant: with my staff alone I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.
p975
sI12
VDeliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; else, I fear, he may come and strike me down, mothers and children alike.
p976
sI13
VYet You have said, \u2018I will deal bountifully with you and make your offspring as the sands of the sea, which are too numerous to count.\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p977
sI14
VAfter spending the night there, he selected from what was at hand these presents for his brother Esau:
p978
sI15
V200 she-goats and 20 he-goats; 200 ewes and 20 rams;
p979
sI16
V30 milch camels with their colts; 40 cows and 10 bulls; 20 she-asses and 10 he-asses.
p980
sI17
VThese he put in the charge of his servants, drove by drove, and he told his servants, \u201cGo on ahead, and keep a distance between droves.\u201d
p981
sI18
VHe instructed the one in front as follows, \u201cWhen my brother Esau meets you and asks you, \u2018Whose man are you? Where are you going? And whose [animals] are these ahead of you?\u2019
p982
sI19
Vyou shall answer, \u2018Your servant Jacob\u2019s; they are a gift sent to my lord Esau; and [Jacob] himself is right behind us.\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p983
sI20
VHe gave similar instructions to the second one, and the third, and all the others who followed the droves, namely, \u201cThus and so shall you say to Esau when you reach him.
p984
sI21
VAnd you shall add, \u2018And your servant Jacob himself is right behind us.\u2019\ufeff\u201d For he reasoned, \u201cIf I propitiate him with presents in advance, and then face him, perhaps he will show me favor.\u201d
p985
sI22
VAnd so the gift went on ahead, while he remained in camp that night.
p986
sI23
VThat same night he arose, and taking his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven children, he crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
p987
sI24
VAfter taking them across the stream, he sent across all his possessions.
p988
sI25
VJacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn.
p989
sI26
VWhen he saw that he had not prevailed against him, he wrenched Jacob\u2019s hip at its socket, so that the socket of his hip was strained as he wrestled with him.
p990
sI27
VThen he said, \u201cLet me go, for dawn is breaking.\u201d But he answered, \u201cI will not let you go, unless you bless me.\u201d
p991
sI28
VSaid the other, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He replied, \u201cJacob.\u201d
p992
sI29
VSaid he, \u201cYour name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with beings divine and human, and have prevailed.\u201d
p993
sI30
VJacob asked, \u201cPray tell me your name.\u201d But he said, \u201cYou must not ask my name!\u201d And he took leave of him there.
p994
sI31
VSo Jacob named the place Peniel, meaning, \u201cI have seen a divine being face to face, yet my life has been preserved.\u201d
p995
sI32
VThe sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping on his hip.
p996
sI33
VThat is why the children of Israel to this day do not eat the thigh muscle that is on the socket of the hip, since Jacob\u2019s hip socket was wrenched at the thigh muscle.

VLooking up, Jacob saw Esau coming, accompanied by four hundred men. He divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maids,
p999
sI2
Vputting the maids and their children first, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.
p1000
sI3
VHe himself went on ahead and bowed low to the ground seven times until he was near his brother.
p1001
sI4
VEsau ran to greet him. He embraced him and, falling on his neck, he kissed him; and they wept.
p1002
sI5
VLooking about, he saw the women and the children. \u201cWho,\u201d he asked, \u201care these with you?\u201d He answered, \u201cThe children with whom God has favored your servant.\u201d
p1003
sI6
VThen the maids, with their children, came forward and bowed low;
p1004
sI7
Vnext Leah, with her children, came forward and bowed low; and last, Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed low;
p1005
sI8
VAnd he asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by all this company which I have met?\u201d He answered, \u201cTo gain my lord\u2019s favor.\u201d
p1006
sI9
VEsau said, \u201cI have enough, my brother; let what you have remain yours.\u201d
p1007
sI10
VBut Jacob said, \u201cNo, I pray you; if you would do me this favor, accept from me this gift; for to see your face is like seeing the face of God, and you have received me favorably.
p1008
sI11
VPlease accept my present which has been brought to you, for God has favored me and I have plenty.\u201d And when he urged him, he accepted.
p1009
sI12
VAnd [Esau] said, \u201cLet us start on our journey, and I will proceed at your pace.\u201d
p1010
sI13
VBut he said to him, \u201cMy lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds, which are nursing, are a care to me; if they are driven hard a single day, all the flocks will die.
p1011
sI14
VLet my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I travel slowly, at the pace of the cattle before me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.\u201d
p1012
sI15
VThen Esau said, \u201cLet me assign to you some of the men who are with me.\u201d But he said, \u201cOh no, my lord is too kind to me!\u201d
p1013
sI16
VSo Esau started back that day on his way to Seir.
p1014
sI17
VBut Jacob journeyed on to Succoth, and built a house for himself and made stalls for his cattle; that is why the place was called Succoth.
p1015

VJacob arrived safe in the city of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan\u2014having come thus from Paddan-aram\u2014and he encamped before the city.

sI19
VThe parcel of land where he pitched his tent he purchased from the children of Hamor, Shechem\u2019s father, for a hundred kesitahs.

VNow Dinah, the daughter whom Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land.

VShechem son of Hamor the Hivite, chief of the country, saw her, and took her and lay with her by force.
p1021

VSo Shechem said to his father Hamor, \u201cGet me this girl as a wife.\u201d
p1023

VJacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah; but since his sons were in the field with his cattle, Jacob kept silent until they came home.

VThen Shechem\u2019s father Hamor came out to Jacob to speak to him.
p1025
sI7
VMeanwhile Jacob\u2019s sons, having heard the news, came in from the field. The men were distressed and very angry, because he had committed an outrage in Israel by lying with Jacob\u2019s daughter\u2014a thing not to be done.

VIntermarry with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves:
p1028
sI10
VYou will dwell among us, and the land will be open before you; settle, move about, and acquire holdings in it.\u201d
p1029
sI11
VThen Shechem said to her father and brothers, \u201cDo me this favor, and I will pay whatever you tell me.
p1030
sI12
VAsk of me a bride-price ever so high, as well as gifts, and I will pay what you tell me; only give me the maiden for a wife.\u201d
p1031
sI13
VJacob\u2019s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor\u2014speaking with guile because he had defiled their sister Dinah\u2014
p1032
sI14
Vand said to them, \u201cWe cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for that is a disgrace among us.
p1033
sI15
VOnly on this condition will we agree with you; that you will become like us in that every male among you is circumcised.
p1034
sI16
VThen we will give our daughters to you and take your daughters to ourselves; and we will dwell among you and become as one kindred.
p1035
sI17
VBut if you will not listen to us and become circumcised, we will take our daughter and go.\u201d
p1036
sI18
VTheir words pleased Hamor and Hamor\u2019s son Shechem.
p1037

VAnd the youth lost no time in doing the thing, for he wanted Jacob\u2019s daughter. Now he was the most respected in his father\u2019s house.
p1038
sI20
VSo Hamor and his son Shechem went to the public place of their town and spoke to their fellow townsmen, saying,
p1039
sI21
V\u201cThese people are our friends; let them settle in the land and move about in it, for the land is large enough for them; we will take their daughters to ourselves as wives and give our daughters to them.

VBut only on this condition will the men agree with us to dwell among us and be as one kindred: that all our males become circumcised as they are circumcised.
p1041

VTheir cattle and substance and all their beasts will be ours, if we only agree to their terms, so that they will settle among us.\u201d

VAnd when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of his brothers, they hated him so that they could not speak a friendly word to him.
p1129
sI5
VOnce Joseph had a dream which he told to his brothers; and they hated him even more.
p1130
sI6
VHe said to them, \u201cHear this dream which I have dreamed:

sI7
VThere we were binding sheaves in the field, when suddenly my sheaf stood up and remained upright; then your sheaves gathered around and bowed low to my sheaf.\u201d

VAnd they said to him, \u201cWe had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.\u201d So Joseph said to them, \u201cSurely God can interpret! Tell me [your dreams].\u201d
p1225
sI9
VThen the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph. He said to him, \u201cIn my dream, there was a vine in front of me.
p1226
sI10
VOn the vine were three branches. It had barely budded, when out came its blossoms and its clusters ripened into grapes.
p1227
sI11
VPharaoh\u2019s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, pressed them into Pharaoh\u2019s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh\u2019s hand.\u201d
p1228
sI12
VJoseph said to him, \u201cThis is its interpretation: The three branches are three days.
p1229
sI13
VIn three days Pharaoh will pardon you and restore you to your post; you will place Pharaoh\u2019s cup in his hand, as was your custom formerly when you were his cupbearer.
p1230
sI14
VBut think of me when all is well with you again, and do me the kindness of mentioning me to Pharaoh, so as to free me from this place.
p1231
sI15
VFor in truth, I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews; nor have I done anything here that they should have put me in the dungeon.\u201d
p1232
sI16
VWhen the chief baker saw how favorably he had interpreted, he said to Joseph, \u201cIn my dream, similarly, there were three openwork baskets on my head.
p1233
sI17
VIn the uppermost basket were all kinds of food for Pharaoh that a baker prepares; and the birds were eating it out of the basket above my head.\u201d
p1234
sI18
VJoseph answered, \u201cThis is its interpretation: The three baskets are three days.
p1235
sI19
VIn three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale you upon a pole; and the birds will pick off your flesh.\u201d
p1236
sI20
VOn the third day\u2014his birthday\u2014Pharaoh made a banquet for all his officials, and he singled out his chief cupbearer and his chief baker from among his officials.
p1237
sI21
VHe restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearing, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh\u2019s hand;
p1238
sI22
Vbut the chief baker he impaled\u2014just as Joseph had interpreted to them.
p1239
sI23
VYet the chief cupbearer did not think of Joseph; he forgot him.

VAfter two years\u2019 time, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,
p1242
sI2
Vwhen out of the Nile there came up seven cows, handsome and sturdy, and they grazed in the reed grass.
p1243
sI3
VBut presently, seven other cows came up from the Nile close behind them, ugly and gaunt, and stood beside the cows on the bank of the Nile;
p1244
sI4
Vand the ugly gaunt cows ate up the seven handsome sturdy cows. And Pharaoh awoke.
p1245
sI5
VHe fell asleep and dreamed a second time: Seven ears of grain, solid and healthy, grew on a single stalk.
p1246
sI6
VBut close behind them sprouted seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind.
p1247
sI7
VAnd the thin ears swallowed up the seven solid and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke: it was a dream!
p1248
sI8
VNext morning, his spirit was agitated, and he sent for all the magicians of Egypt, and all its wise men; and Pharaoh told them his dreams, but none could interpret them for Pharaoh.
p1249
sI9
VThe chief cupbearer then spoke up and said to Pharaoh, \u201cI must make mention today of my offenses.
p1250
sI10
VOnce Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and placed me in custody in the house of the chief steward, together with the chief baker.
p1251
sI11
VWe had dreams the same night, he and I, each of us a dream with a meaning of its own.
p1252
sI12
VA Hebrew youth was there with us, a servant of the chief steward; and when we told him our dreams, he interpreted them for us, telling each of the meaning of his dream.
p1253
sI13
VAnd as he interpreted for us, so it came to pass: I was restored to my post, and the other was impaled.\u201d
p1254
sI14
VThereupon Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was rushed from the dungeon. He had his hair cut and changed his clothes, and he appeared before Pharaoh.
p1255
sI15
VAnd Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cI have had a dream, but no one can interpret it. Now I have heard it said of you that for you to hear a dream is to tell its meaning.\u201d
p1256
sI16
VJoseph answered Pharaoh, saying, \u201cNot I! God will see to Pharaoh\u2019s welfare.\u201d
p1257
sI17
VThen Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cIn my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile,
p1258
sI18
Vwhen out of the Nile came up seven sturdy and well-formed cows and grazed in the reed grass.
p1259
sI19
VPresently there followed them seven other cows, scrawny, ill-formed, and emaciated\u2014never had I seen their likes for ugliness in all the land of Egypt!
p1260
sI20
VAnd the seven lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven cows, the sturdy ones;
p1261
sI21
Vbut when they had consumed them, one could not tell that they had consumed them, for they looked just as bad as before. And I awoke.
p1262
sI22
VIn my other dream, I saw seven ears of grain, full and healthy, growing on a single stalk;
p1263
sI23
Vbut right behind them sprouted seven ears, shriveled, thin, and scorched by the east wind.
p1264
sI24
VAnd the thin ears swallowed the seven healthy ears. I have told my magicians, but none has an explanation for me.\u201d
p1265
sI25
VAnd Joseph said to Pharaoh, \u201cPharaoh\u2019s dreams are one and the same: God has told Pharaoh what He is about to do.
p1266
sI26
VThe seven healthy cows are seven years, and the seven healthy ears are seven years; it is the same dream.
p1267
sI27
VThe seven lean and ugly cows that followed are seven years, as are also the seven empty ears scorched by the east wind; they are seven years of famine.
p1268
sI28
VIt is just as I have told Pharaoh: God has revealed to Pharaoh what He is about to do.
p1269
sI29
VImmediately ahead are seven years of great abundance in all the land of Egypt.
p1270
sI30
VAfter them will come seven years of famine, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten. As the land is ravaged by famine,
p1271
sI31
Vno trace of the abundance will be left in the land because of the famine thereafter, for it will be very severe.
p1272
sI32
VAs for Pharaoh having had the same dream twice, it means that the matter has been determined by God, and that God will soon carry it out.
p1273
sI33
V\u201cAccordingly, let Pharaoh find a man of discernment and wisdom, and set him over the land of Egypt.
p1274
sI34
VAnd let Pharaoh take steps to appoint overseers over the land, and organize the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty.
p1275
sI35
VLet all the food of these good years that are coming be gathered, and let the grain be collected under Pharaoh\u2019s authority as food to be stored in the cities.
p1276
sI36
VLet that food be a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will come upon the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish in the famine.\u201d
p1277
sI37
VThe plan pleased Pharaoh and all his courtiers.
p1278
sI38
VAnd Pharaoh said to his courtiers, \u201cCould we find another like him, a man in whom is the spirit of God?\u201d
p1279
sI39
VSo Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cSince God has made all this known to you, there is none so discerning and wise as you.
p1280
sI40
VYou shall be in charge of my court, and by your command shall all my people be directed; only with respect to the throne shall I be superior to you.\u201d
p1281
sI41
VPharaoh further said to Joseph, \u201cSee, I put you in charge of all the land of Egypt.\u201d
p1282
sI42
VAnd removing his signet ring from his hand, Pharaoh put it on Joseph\u2019s hand; and he had him dressed in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck.
p1283
sI43
VHe had him ride in the chariot of his second-in-command, and they cried before him, \u201cAbrek!\u201d Thus he placed him over all the land of Egypt.
p1284
sI44
VPharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cI am Pharaoh; yet without you, no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\u201d
p1285
sI45
VPharaoh then gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him for a wife Asenath daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On. Thus Joseph emerged in charge of the land of Egypt.\u2014
p1286
sI46
VJoseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt.\u2014Leaving Pharaoh\u2019s presence, Joseph traveled through all the land of Egypt.
p1287
sI47
VDuring the seven years of plenty, the land produced in abundance.
p1288
sI48
VAnd he gathered all the grain of the seven years that the land of Egypt was enjoying, and stored the grain in the cities; he put in each city the grain of the fields around it.
p1289
sI49
VSo Joseph collected produce in very large quantity, like the sands of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.
p1290
sI50
VBefore the years of famine came, Joseph became the father of two sons, whom Asenath daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On, bore to him.
p1291
sI51
VJoseph named the first-born Manasseh, meaning, \u201cGod has made me forget completely my hardship and my parental home.\u201d
p1292
sI52
VAnd the second he named Ephraim, meaning, \u201cGod has made me fertile in the land of my affliction.\u201d
p1293
sI53
VThe seven years of abundance that the land of Egypt enjoyed came to an end,
p1294
sI54
Vand the seven years of famine set in, just as Joseph had foretold. There was famine in all lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was bread.
p1295
sI55
VAnd when all the land of Egypt felt the hunger, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, \u201cGo to Joseph; whatever he tells you, you shall do.\u201d\u2014
p1296
sI56
VAccordingly, when the famine became severe in the land of Egypt, Joseph laid open all that was within, and rationed out grain to the Egyptians. The famine, however, spread over the whole world.
p1297
sI57
VSo all the world came to Joseph in Egypt to procure rations, for the famine had become severe throughout the world.
p1298
ssI42
(dp1299
I1
VWhen Jacob saw that there were food rations to be had in Egypt, he said to his sons, \u201cWhy do you keep looking at one another?
p1300
sI2
VNow I hear,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat there are rations to be had in Egypt. Go down and procure rations for us there, that we may live and not die.\u201d
p1301
sI3
VSo ten of Joseph\u2019s brothers went down to get grain rations in Egypt;
p1302
sI4
Vfor Jacob did not send Joseph\u2019s brother Benjamin with his brothers, since he feared that he might meet with disaster.
p1303
sI5
VThus the sons of Israel were among those who came to procure rations, for the famine extended to the land of Canaan.
p1304
sI6
VNow Joseph was the vizier of the land; it was he who dispensed rations to all the people of the land. And Joseph\u2019s brothers came and bowed low to him, with their faces to the ground.
p1305
sI7
VWhen Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them; but he acted like a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them. He asked them, \u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d And they said, \u201cFrom the land of Canaan, to procure food.\u201d
p1306
sI8
VFor though Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.
p1307
sI9
VRecalling the dreams that he had dreamed about them, Joseph said to them, \u201cYou are spies, you have come to see the land in its nakedness.\u201d
p1308
sI10
VBut they said to him, \u201cNo, my lord! Truly, your servants have come to procure food.
p1309
sI11
VWe are all of us sons of the same man; we are honest men; your servants have never been spies!\u201d
p1310
sI12
VAnd he said to them, \u201cNo, you have come to see the land in its nakedness!\u201d
p1311
sI13
VAnd they replied, \u201cWe your servants were twelve brothers, sons of a certain man in the land of Canaan; the youngest, however, is now with our father, and one is no more.\u201d
p1312
sI14
VBut Joseph said to them, \u201cIt is just as I have told you: You are spies!
p1313
sI15
VBy this you shall be put to the test: unless your youngest brother comes here, by Pharaoh, you shall not depart from this place!
p1314
sI16
VLet one of you go and bring your brother, while the rest of you remain confined, that your words may be put to the test whether there is truth in you. Else, by Pharaoh, you are nothing but spies!\u201d
p1315
sI17
VAnd he confined them in the guardhouse for three days.
p1316
sI18
VOn the third day Joseph said to them, \u201cDo this and you shall live, for I am a God-fearing man.
p1317
sI19
VIf you are honest men, let one of you brothers be held in your place of detention, while the rest of you go and take home rations for your starving households;
p1318
sI20
Vbut you must bring me your youngest brother, that your words may be verified and that you may not die.\u201d And they did accordingly.
p1319
sI21
VThey said to one another, \u201cAlas, we are being punished on account of our brother, because we looked on at his anguish, yet paid no heed as he pleaded with us. That is why this distress has come upon us.\u201d
p1320
sI22
VThen Reuben spoke up and said to them, \u201cDid I not tell you, \u2018Do no wrong to the  boy\u2019? But you paid no heed. Now comes the reckoning for his blood.\u201d
p1321
sI23
VThey did not know that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between him and them.
p1322
sI24
VHe turned away from them and wept. But he came back to them and spoke to them; and he took Simeon from among them and had him bound before their eyes.
p1323
sI25
VThen Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, return each one\u2019s money to his sack, and give them provisions for the journey; and this was done for them.
p1324
sI26
VSo they loaded their asses with the rations and departed from there.
p1325
sI27
VAs one of them was opening his sack to give feed to his ass at the night encampment, he saw his money right there at the mouth of his bag.
p1326
sI28
VAnd he said to his brothers, \u201cMy money has been returned! It is here in my bag!\u201d Their hearts sank; and, trembling, they turned to one another, saying, \u201cWhat is this that God has done to us?\u201d
p1327
sI29
VWhen they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had befallen them, saying,
p1328
sI30
V\u201cThe man who is lord of the land spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the land.
p1329
sI31
VWe said to him, \u2018We are honest men; we have never been spies!
p1330
sI32
VThere were twelve of us brothers, sons by the same father; but one is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.\u2019
p1331
sI33
VBut the man who is lord of the land said to us, \u2018By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take something for your starving households and be off.
p1332
sI34
VAnd bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know that you are not spies but honest men. I will then restore your brother to you, and you shall be free to move about in the land.\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p1333
sI35
VAs they were emptying their sacks, there, in each one\u2019s sack, was his money-bag! When they and their father saw their money-bags, they were dismayed.
p1334
sI36
VTheir father Jacob said to them, \u201cIt is always me that you bereave: Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you would take away Benjamin. These things always happen to me!\u201d
p1335
sI37
VThen Reuben said to his father, \u201cYou may kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my care, and I will return him to you.\u201d
p1336
sI38
VBut he said, \u201cMy son must not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone is left. If he meets with disaster on the journey you are taking, you will send my white head down to Sheol in grief.\u201d
p1337
ssI43
(dp1338
I1
VBut the famine in the land was severe.
p1339
sI2
VAnd when they had eaten up the rations which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, \u201cGo again and procure some food for us.\u201d
p1340
sI3
VBut Judah said to him, \u201cThe man warned us, \u2018Do not let me see your faces unless your brother is with you.\u2019
p1341
sI4
VIf you will let our brother go with us, we will go down and procure food for you;
p1342
sI5
Vbut if you will not let him go, we will not go down, for the man said to us, \u2018Do not let me see your faces unless your brother is with you.\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p1343
sI6
VAnd Israel said, \u201cWhy did you serve me so ill as to tell the man that you had another brother?\u201d
p1344
sI7
VThey replied, \u201cBut the man kept asking about us and our family, saying, \u2018Is your father still living? Have you another brother?\u2019 And we answered him accordingly. How were we to know that he would say, \u2018Bring your brother here\u2019?\u201d
p1345
sI8
VThen Judah said to his father Israel, \u201cSend the boy in my care, and let us be on our way, that we may live and not die\u2014you and we and our children.
p1346
sI9
VI myself will be surety for him; you may hold me responsible: if I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, I shall stand guilty before you forever.
p1347
sI10
VFor we could have been there and back twice if we had not dawdled.\u201d
p1348
sI11
VThen their father Israel said to them, \u201cIf it must be so, do this: take some of the choice products of the land in your baggage, and carry them down as a gift for the man\u2014some balm and some honey, gum, ladanum, pistachio nuts, and almonds.
p1349
sI12
VAnd take with you double the money, carrying back with you the money that was replaced in the mouths of your bags; perhaps it was a mistake.
p1350
sI13
VTake your brother too; and go back at once to the man.
p1351
sI14
VAnd may El Shaddai dispose the man to mercy toward you, that he may release to you your other brother, as well as Benjamin. As for me, if I am to be bereaved, I shall be bereaved.\u201d
p1352
sI15
VSo the men took that gift, and they took with them double the money, as well as Benjamin. They made their way down to Egypt, where they presented themselves to Joseph.
p1353
sI16
VWhen Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his house steward, \u201cTake the men into the house; slaughter and prepare an animal, for the men will dine with me at noon.\u201d
p1354
sI17
VThe man did as Joseph said, and he brought the men into Joseph\u2019s house.
p1355
sI18
VBut the men were frightened at being brought into Joseph\u2019s house. \u201cIt must be,\u201d they thought, \u201cbecause of the money replaced in our bags the first time that we have been brought inside, as a pretext to attack us and seize us as slaves, with our pack animals.\u201d
p1356
sI19
VSo they went up to Joseph\u2019s house steward and spoke to him at the entrance of the house.
p1357
sI20
V\u201cIf you please, my lord,\u201d they said, \u201cwe came down once before to procure food.
p1358
sI21
VBut when we arrived at the night encampment and opened our bags, there was each one\u2019s money in the mouth of his bag, our money in full. So we have brought it back with us.
p1359
sI22
VAnd we have brought down with us other money to procure food. We do not know who put the money in our bags.\u201d
p1360
sI23
VHe replied, \u201cAll is well with you; do not be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, must have put treasure in your bags for you. I got your payment.\u201d And he brought out Simeon to them.
p1361
sI24
VThen the man brought the men into Joseph\u2019s house; he gave them water to bathe their feet, and he provided feed for their asses.
p1362
sI25
VThey laid out their gifts to await Joseph\u2019s arrival at noon, for they had heard that they were to dine there.
p1363
sI26
VWhen Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts that they had brought with them into the house, bowing low before him to the ground.
p1364
sI27
VHe greeted them, and he said, \u201cHow is your aged father of whom you spoke? Is he still in good health?\u201d
p1365
sI28
VThey replied, \u201cIt is well with your servant our father; he is still in good health.\u201d And they bowed and made obeisance.
p1366
sI29
VLooking about, he saw his brother Benjamin, his mother\u2019s son, and asked, \u201cIs this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me?\u201d And he went on, \u201cMay God be gracious to you, my boy.\u201d
p1367
sI30
VWith that, Joseph hurried out, for he was overcome with feeling toward his brother and was on the verge of tears; he went into a room and wept there.
p1368
sI31
VThen he washed his face, reappeared, and\u2014now in control of himself\u2014gave the order, \u201cServe the meal.\u201d
p1369
sI32
VThey served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; for the Egyptians could not dine with the Hebrews, since that would be abhorrent to the Egyptians.
p1370
sI33
VAs they were seated by his direction, from the oldest in the order of his seniority to the youngest in the order of his youth, the men looked at one another in astonishment.
p1371
sI34
VPortions were served them from his table; but Benjamin\u2019s portion was several times that of anyone else. And they drank their fill with him.
p1372
ssI44
(dp1373
I1
VThen he instructed his house steward as follows, \u201cFill the men\u2019s bags with food, as much as they can carry, and put each one\u2019s money in the mouth of his bag.
p1374
sI2
VPut my silver goblet in the mouth of the bag of the youngest one, together with his money for the rations.\u201d And he did as Joseph told him.
p1375
sI3
VWith the first light of morning, the men were sent off with their pack animals.
p1376
sI4
VThey had just left the city and had not gone far, when Joseph said to his steward, \u201cUp, go after the men! And when you overtake them, say to them, \u2018Why did you repay good with evil?
p1377
sI5
VIt is the very one from which my master drinks and which he uses for divination. It was a wicked thing for you to do!\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p1378
sI6
VHe overtook them and spoke those words to them.
p1379
sI7
VAnd they said to him, \u201cWhy does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything of the kind!
p1380
sI8
VHere we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money that we found in the mouths of our bags. How then could we have stolen any silver or gold from your master\u2019s house!
p1381
sI9
VWhichever of your servants it is found with shall die; the rest of us, moreover, shall become slaves to my lord.\u201d
p1382
sI10
VHe replied, \u201cAlthough what you are proposing is right, only the one with whom it is found shall be my slave; but the rest of you shall go free.\u201d
p1383
sI11
VSo each one hastened to lower his bag to the ground, and each one opened his bag.
p1384
sI12
VHe searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the goblet turned up in Benjamin\u2019s bag.
p1385
sI13
VAt this they rent their clothes. Each reloaded his pack animal, and they returned to the city.
p1386
sI14
VWhen Judah and his brothers reentered the house of Joseph, who was still there, they threw themselves on the ground before him.
p1387
sI15
VJoseph said to them, \u201cWhat is this deed that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me practices divination?\u201d

VJudah replied, \u201cWhat can we say to my lord? How can we plead, how can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered the crime of your servants. Here we are, then, slaves of my lord, the rest of us as much as he in whose possession the goblet was found.\u201d

p1392

VWe told my lord, \u2018We have an old father, and there is a child of his old age, the youngest; his full brother is dead, so that he alone is left of his mother, and his father dotes on him.\u2019

VYour servant my father said to us, \u2018As you know, my wife bore me two sons.

VBut one is gone from me, and I said: Alas, he was torn by a beast! And I have not seen him since.

Vwhen he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will send the white head of your servant our father down to Sheol in grief.

VNow your servant has pledged himself for the boy to my father, saying, \u2018If I do not bring him back to you, I shall stand guilty before my father forever.\u2019
p1405
sI33
VTherefore, please let your servant remain as a slave to my lord instead of the boy, and let the boy go back with his brothers.

p1475
sI4
VWe have come,\u201d they told Pharaoh, \u201cto sojourn in this land, for there is no pasture for your servants\u2019 flocks, the famine being severe in the land of Canaan. Pray, then, let your servants stay in the region of Goshen.\u201d
p1476
sI5
VThen Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cAs regards your father and your brothers who have come to you,
p1477
sI6
Vthe land of Egypt is open before you: settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land; let them stay in the region of Goshen. And if you know any capable men among them, put them in charge of my livestock.\u201d

VPharaoh asked Jacob, \u201cHow many are the years of your life?\u201d
p1480
sI9
VAnd Jacob answered Pharaoh, \u201cThe years of my sojourn [on earth] are one hundred and thirty. Few and hard have been the years of my life, nor do they come up to the life spans of my fathers during their sojourns.\u201d
p1481
sI10
VThen Jacob bade Pharaoh farewell, and left Pharaoh\u2019s presence.
p1482
sI11
VSo Joseph settled his father and his brothers, giving them holdings in the choicest part of the land of Egypt, in the region of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
p1483
sI12
VJoseph sustained his father, and his brothers, and all his father\u2019s household with bread, down to the little ones.
p1484
sI13
VNow there was no bread in all the world, for the famine was very severe; both the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.
p1485
sI14
VJoseph gathered in all the money that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, as payment for the rations that were being procured, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh\u2019s palace.
p1486
sI15
VAnd when the money gave out in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, \u201cGive us bread, lest we die before your very eyes; for the money is gone!\u201d
p1487
sI16
VAnd Joseph said, \u201cBring your livestock, and I will sell to you against your livestock, if the money is gone.\u201d
p1488
sI17
VSo they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, for the stocks of sheep and cattle, and the asses; thus he provided them with bread that year in exchange for all their livestock.
p1489
sI18
VAnd when that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, \u201cWe cannot hide from my lord that, with all the money and animal stocks consigned to my lord, nothing is left at my lord\u2019s disposal save our persons and our farmland.
p1490
sI19
VLet us not perish before your eyes, both we and our land. Take us and our land in exchange for bread, and we with our land will be serfs to Pharaoh; provide the seed, that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become a waste.\u201d
p1491
sI20
VSo Joseph gained possession of all the farm land of Egypt for Pharaoh, every Egyptian having sold his field because the famine was too much for them; thus the land passed over to Pharaoh.
p1492
sI21
VAnd he removed the population town by town, from one end of Egypt\u2019s border to the other.
p1493
sI22
VOnly the land of the priests he did not take over, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they lived off the allotment which Pharaoh had made to them; therefore they did not sell their land.
p1494
sI23
VThen Joseph said to the people, \u201cWhereas I have this day acquired you and your land for Pharaoh, here is seed for you to sow the land.
p1495
sI24
VAnd when harvest comes, you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be yours as seed for the fields and as food for you and those in your households, and as nourishment for your children.\u201d
p1496
sI25
VAnd they said, \u201cYou have saved our lives! We are grateful to my lord, and we shall be serfs to Pharaoh.\u201d
p1497
sI26
VAnd Joseph made it into a land law in Egypt, which is still valid, that a fifth should be Pharaoh\u2019s; only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh\u2019s.
p1498
sI27
VThus Israel settled in the country of Egypt, in the region of Goshen; they acquired holdings in it, and were fertile and increased greatly.\u05d5\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9

sI28
VJacob lived seventeen years in the land of Egypt, so that the span of Jacob\u2019s life came to one hundred and forty-seven years.

VAnd when the time approached for Israel to die, he summoned his son Joseph and said to him, \u201cDo me this favor, place your hand under my thigh as a pledge of your steadfast loyalty: please do not bury me in Egypt.
p1501
sI30
VWhen I lie down with my fathers, take me up from Egypt and bury me in their burial-place.\u201d He replied, \u201cI will do as you have spoken.\u201d

VWhen Joseph saw that his father was placing his right hand on Ephraim\u2019s head, he thought it wrong; so he took hold of his father\u2019s hand to move it from Ephraim\u2019s head to Manasseh\u2019s.
p1521

V\u201cNot so, Father,\u201d Joseph said to his father, \u201cfor the other is the first-born; place your right hand on his head.\u201d

VThen Joseph ordered the physicians in his service to embalm his father, and the physicians embalmed Israel.
p1563

VIt required forty days, for such is the full period of embalming. The Egyptians bewailed him seventy days;
p1564

Vand when the wailing period was over, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh\u2019s court, saying, \u201cDo me this favor, and lay this appeal before Pharaoh:
p1565
sI5
V\u2018My father made me swear, saying, \u201cI am about to die. Be sure to bury me in the grave which I made ready for myself in the land of Canaan.\u201d Now, therefore, let me go up and bury my father; then I shall return.\u2019\ufeff\u201d

p1568
sI8
Vtogether with all of Joseph\u2019s household, his brothers, and his father\u2019s household; only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the region of Goshen.

VChariots, too, and horsemen went up with him; it was a very large troop.

VWhen they came to Goren ha-Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they held there a very great and solemn lamentation; and he observed a mourning period of seven days for his father.
p1571
sI11
VAnd when the Canaanite inhabitants of the land saw the mourning at Goren ha-Atad, they said, \u201cThis is a solemn mourning on the part of the Egyptians.\u201d That is why it was named Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
p1572
sI12
VThus his sons did for him as he had instructed them.
p1573
sI13
VHis sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, the field near Mamre, which Abraham had bought for a burial site from Ephron the Hittite.

VAfter burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.
p1575
sI15
VWhen Joseph\u2019s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, \u201cWhat if Joseph still bears a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrong that we did him!\u201d
p1576
sI16
VSo they sent this message to Joseph, \u201cBefore his death your father left this instruction:
p1577
sI17
VSo shall you say to Joseph, \u2018Forgive, I urge you, the offense and guilt of your brothers who treated you so harshly.\u2019 Therefore, please forgive the offense of the servants of the God of your father.\u201d And Joseph was in tears as they spoke to him.
p1578
sI18
VHis brothers went to him themselves, flung themselves before him, and said, \u201cWe are prepared to be your slaves.\u201d
p1579
sI19
VBut Joseph said to them, \u201cHave no fear! Am I a substitute for God?
p1580
sI20
VBesides, although you intended me harm, God intended it for good, so as to bring about the present result\u2014the survival of many people.
p1581
sI21
VAnd so, fear not. I will sustain you and your children.\u201d Thus he reassured them, speaking kindly to them.

VSo Joseph and his father\u2019s household remained in Egypt. Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.

VJoseph lived to see children of the third generation of Ephraim; the children of Machir son of Manasseh were likewise born upon Joseph\u2019s knees.

VAt length, Joseph said to his brothers, \u201cI am about to die. God will surely take notice of you and bring you up from this land to the land that He promised on oath to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\u201d

p1760

VThen Pharaoh, for his part, summoned the wise men and the sorcerers; and the Egyptian magicians, in turn, did the same with their spells;

Veach cast down his rod, and they turned into serpents. But Aaron\u2019s rod swallowed their rods.

VAaron held out his arm over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.

VThen Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh\u2019s presence, and Moses cried out to the Lord in the matter of the frogs which He had inflicted upon Pharaoh.
p1788
sI9
VAnd the Lord did as Moses asked; the frogs died out in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields.
p1789
sI10
VAnd they piled them up in heaps, till the land stank.
p1790
sI11
VBut when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he became stubborn and would not heed them, as the Lord had spoken.

VThen the Lord said to Moses, \u201cSay to Aaron: Hold out your rod and strike the dust of the earth, and it shall turn to lice throughout the land of Egypt.\u201d
p1792
sI13
VAnd they did so. Aaron held out his arm with the rod and struck the dust of the earth, and vermin came upon man and beast; all the dust of the earth turned to lice throughout the land of Egypt.
p1793
sI14
VThe magicians did the like with their spells to produce lice, but they could not. The vermin remained upon man and beast;
p1794

Vand the magicians said to Pharaoh, \u201cThis is the finger of God!\u201d But Pharaoh\u2019s heart stiffened and he would not heed them, as the Lord had spoken.

VAnd the Lord said to Moses, \u201cEarly in the morning present yourself to Pharaoh, as he is coming out to the water, and say to him, \u2018Thus says the Lord: Let My people go that they may worship Me.
p1796
sI17
VFor if you do not let My people go, I will let loose swarms of insects against you and your courtiers and your people and your houses; the houses of the Egyptians, and the very ground they stand on, shall be filled with swarms of insects.
p1797
sI18
VBut on that day I will set apart the region of Goshen, where My people dwell, so that no swarms of insects shall be there, that you may know that I the Lord am in the midst of the land.

sI19
VAnd I will make a distinction between My people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall come to pass.\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p1799
sI20
VAnd the Lord did so. Heavy swarms of insects invaded Pharaoh\u2019s palace and the houses of his courtiers; throughout the country of Egypt the land was ruined because of the swarms of insects.
p1800
sI21
VThen Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, \u201cGo and sacrifice to your God within the land.\u201d
p1801
sI22
VBut Moses replied, \u201cIt would not be right to do this, for what we sacrifice to the Lord our God is untouchable to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice that which is untouchable to the Egyptians before their very eyes, will they not stone us!
p1802
sI23
VSo we must go a distance of three days into the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God as He may command us.\u201d
p1803
sI24
VPharaoh said, \u201cI will let you go to sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness; but do not go very far. Plead, then, for me.\u201d
p1804
sI25
VAnd Moses said, \u201cWhen I leave your presence, I will plead with the Lord that the swarms of insects depart tomorrow from Pharaoh and his courtiers and his people; but let not Pharaoh again act deceitfully, not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.\u201d
p1805
sI26
VSo Moses left Pharaoh\u2019s presence and pleaded with the Lord.
p1806
sI27
VAnd the Lord did as Moses asked: He removed the swarms of insects from Pharaoh, from his courtiers, and from his people; not one remained.

VBut Pharaoh became stubborn this time also, and would not let the people go.

VThe Lord said to Moses, \u201cGo to Pharaoh and say to him, \u2018Thus says the Lord, the God of the Hebrews: Let My people go to worship Me.
p1810
sI2
VFor if you refuse to let them go, and continue to hold them,
p1811
sI3
Vthen the hand of the Lord will strike your livestock in the fields\u2014the horses, the asses, the camels, the cattle, and the sheep\u2014with a very severe pestilence.
p1812
sI4
VBut the Lord will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of the Egyptians, so that nothing shall die of all that belongs to the Israelites.
p1813
sI5
VThe Lord has fixed the time: tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the land.\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p1814
sI6
VAnd the Lord did so the next day: all the livestock of the Egyptians died, but of the livestock of the Israelites not a beast died.
p1815
sI7
VWhen Pharaoh inquired, he found that not a head of the livestock of Israel had died; yet Pharaoh remained stubborn, and he would not let the people go.
p1816

VThen the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, \u201cEach of you take handfuls of soot from the kiln, and let Moses throw it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.
p1817
sI9
VIt shall become a fine dust all over the land of Egypt, and cause an inflammation breaking out in boils on man and beast throughout the land of Egypt.\u201d
p1818

VSo they took soot of the kiln and appeared before Pharaoh; Moses threw it toward the sky, and it caused an inflammation breaking out in boils on man and beast.
p1819
sI11
VThe magicians were unable to confront Moses because of the inflammation, for the inflammation afflicted the magicians as well as all the other Egyptians.
p1820

VBut the Lord stiffened the heart of Pharaoh, and he would not heed them, just as the Lord had told Moses.
p1821

VFor this time I will send all My plagues upon your person, and your courtiers, and your people, in order that you may know that there is none like Me in all the world.

VNevertheless I have spared you for this purpose: in order to show you My power, and in order that My fame may resound throughout the world.
p1825
sI17
VYet you continue to thwart My people, and do not let them go!
p1826
sI18
VThis time tomorrow I will rain down a very heavy hail, such as has not been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
p1827
sI19
VTherefore, order your livestock and everything you have in the open brought under shelter; every man and beast that is found outside, not having been brought indoors, shall perish when the hail comes down upon them!\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p1828
sI20
VThose among Pharaoh\u2019s courtiers who feared the Lord\u2018s word brought their slaves and livestock indoors to safety;
p1829
sI21
Vbut those who paid no regard to the word of the Lord left their slaves and livestock in the open.
p1830
sI22
VThe Lord said to Moses, \u201cHold out your arm toward the sky that hail may fall on all the land of Egypt, upon man and beast and all the grasses of the field in the land of Egypt.\u201d
p1831
sI23
VSo Moses held out his rod toward the sky, and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and fire streamed down to the ground, as the Lord rained down hail upon the land of Egypt.
p1832
sI24
VThe hail was very heavy\u2014fire flashing in the midst of the hail\u2014such as had not fallen on the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.
p1833
sI25
VThroughout the land of Egypt the hail struck down all that were in the open, both man and beast; the hail also struck down all the grasses of the field and shattered all the trees of the field.
p1834
sI26
VOnly in the region of Goshen, where the Israelites were, there was no hail.
p1835
sI27
VThereupon Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said to them, \u201cI stand guilty this time. The Lord is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.

VPlead with the Lord that there may be an end of God\u2019s thunder and of hail. I will let you go; you need stay no longer.\u201d
p1837

VMoses said to him, \u201cAs I go out of the city, I shall spread out my hands to the Lord; the thunder will cease and the hail will fall no more, so that you may know that the earth is the Lord\u2018s.
p1838
sI30
VBut I know that you and your courtiers do not yet fear the Lord God.\u201d\u2014
p1839
sI31
VNow the flax and barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud;
p1840
sI32
Vbut the wheat and the emmer were not hurt, for they ripen late.\u2014
p1841
sI33
VLeaving Pharaoh, Moses went outside the city and spread out his hands to the Lord: the thunder and the hail ceased, and no rain came pouring down upon the earth.
p1842
sI34
VBut when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he became stubborn and reverted to his guilty ways, as did his courtiers.
p1843
sI35
VSo Pharaoh\u2019s heart stiffened and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the Lord had foretold through Moses.
p1844
ssI10
(dp1845

VThen the Lord said to Moses, \u201cGo to Pharaoh. For I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his courtiers, in order that I may display these My signs among them,

VThey shall cover the surface of the land, so that no one will be able to see the land. They shall devour the surviving remnant that was left to you after the hail; and they shall eat away all your trees that grow in the field.
p1850
sI6
VMoreover, they shall fill your palaces and the houses of all your courtiers and of all the Egyptians\u2014something that neither your  fathers nor fathers\u2019 fathers have seen from the day they appeared on earth to this day.\u2019\ufeff\u201d With that he turned and left Pharaoh\u2019s presence.
p1851
sI7
VPharaoh\u2019s courtiers said to him, \u201cHow long shall this one be a snare to us? Let the men go to worship the Lord their God! Are you not yet aware that Egypt is lost?\u201d
p1852
sI8
VSo Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh and he said to them, \u201cGo, worship the Lord your God! Who are the ones to go?\u201d
p1853
sI9
VMoses replied, \u201cWe will all go, young and old: we will go with our sons and daughters, our flocks and herds; for we must observe the Lord\u2018s festival.\u201d
p1854
sI10
VBut he said to them, \u201cThe Lord be with you the same as I mean to let your children go with you! Clearly, you are bent on mischief.
p1855
sI11
VNo! You menfolk go and worship the Lord, since that is what you want.\u201d And they were expelled from Pharaoh\u2019s presence.
p1856
sI12
VThen the Lord said to Moses, \u201cHold out your arm over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt and eat up all the grasses in the land, whatever the hail has left.\u201d
p1857
sI13
VSo Moses held out his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord drove an east wind over the land all that day and all night; and when morning came, the east wind had brought the locusts.
p1858
sI14
VLocusts invaded all the land of Egypt and settled within all the territory of Egypt in a thick mass; never before had there been so many, nor will there ever be so many again.
p1859
sI15
VThey hid all the land from view, and the land was darkened; and they ate up all the grasses of the field and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left, so that nothing green was left, of tree or grass of the field, in all the land of Egypt.
p1860

VPharaoh hurriedly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, \u201cI  stand guilty before the Lord your God and before you.

sI17
VForgive my offense just this once, and plead with the Lord your God that He but remove this death from me.\u201d

VSo he left Pharaoh\u2019s presence and pleaded with the Lord.

sI19
VThe Lord caused a shift to a very strong west wind, which lifted the locusts and hurled them into the Sea of Reeds; not a single locust remained in all the territory of Egypt.

VBut the Lord stiffened Pharaoh\u2019s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.

VMoses held out his arm toward the sky and thick darkness descended upon all the land of Egypt for three days.

VPeople could not see one another, and for three days no one could get up from where he was; but all the Israelites enjoyed light in their dwellings.

VBut Moses said, \u201cYou yourself must provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings to offer up to the Lord our God;

p1951
sI14
VAnd when, in time to come, your son asks you, saying, \u2018What does this mean?\u2019 you shall say to him, \u2018It was with a mighty hand that the Lord brought us out from Egypt, the house of bondage.
p1952
sI15
VWhen Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the Lord slew every first-born in the land of Egypt, the first-born of both man and beast. Therefore I sacrifice to the Lord every first male issue of the womb, but redeem every first-born among my sons.\u2019

p1972
sI12
VIs this not the very thing we told you in Egypt, saying, \u2018Let us be, and we will serve the Egyptians, for it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness\u2019?\u201d

p3036
sI14
VHe led forward the bull of sin offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bull of sin offering,

sI15
Vand it was slaughtered. Moses took the blood and with his finger put some on each of the horns of the altar, cleansing the altar; then he poured out the blood at the base of the altar. Thus he consecrated it in order to make expiation upon it.

VMoses then took all the fat that was about the entrails, and the protuberance of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and turned them into smoke on the altar.

VThe rest of the bull, its hide, its flesh, and its dung, he put to the fire outside the camp\u2014as the Lord had commanded Moses.
p3040
sI18
VThen he brought forward the ram of burnt offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the ram\u2019s head,

Vand it was slaughtered. Moses dashed the blood against all sides of the altar.

VAnd Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it upon Aaron and upon his vestments, and also upon his sons and upon their vestments. Thus he consecrated Aaron and his vestments, and also his sons and their vestments.

VMoses said to Aaron and his sons: Boil the flesh at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of ordination\u2014as I commanded: Aaron and his sons shall eat it;

VYou shall place the Levites in attendance upon Aaron and his sons, and designate them as an elevation offering to the Lord.

p4112

Vthey shall offer it in the second month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs,

sI12
Vand they shall not leave any of it over until morning. They shall not break a bone of it. They shall offer it in strict accord with the law of the passover sacrifice.

sI13
VBut if a man who is clean and not on a journey refrains from offering the passover sacrifice, that person shall be cut off from his kin, for he did not present the Lord\u2019s offering at its set time; that man shall bear his guilt.

VBalaam said to God, \u201cBalak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:
p4534
sI11
VHere is a people that came out from Egypt and hides the earth from view. Come now and curse them for me; perhaps I can engage them in battle and drive them off.\u201d
p4535
sI12
VBut God said to Balaam, \u201cDo not go with them. You must not curse that people, for they are blessed.\u201d
p4536
sI13
VBalaam arose in the morning and said to Balak\u2019s dignitaries, \u201cGo back to your own country, for the Lord will not let me go with you.\u201d
p4537
sI14
VThe Moabite dignitaries left, and they came to Balak and said, \u201cBalaam refused to come with us.\u201d
p4538
sI15
VThen Balak sent other dignitaries, more numerous and distinguished than the first.
p4539
sI16
VThey came to Balaam and said to him, \u201cThus says Balak son of Zippor: Please do not refuse to come to me.

VI will reward you richly and I will do anything you ask of me. Only come and damn this people for me.\u201d
p4541
sI18
VBalaam replied to Balak\u2019s officials, \u201cThough Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, big or little, contrary to the command of the Lord my God.
p4542
sI19
VSo you, too, stay here overnight, and let me find out what else the Lord may say to me.\u201d
p4543
sI20
VThat night God came to Balaam and said to him, \u201cIf these men have come to invite you, you may go with them. But whatever I command you, that you shall do.\u201d
p4544
sI21
VWhen he arose in the morning, Balaam saddled his ass and departed with the Moabite dignitaries.
p4545
sI22
VBut God was incensed at his going; so an angel of the Lord placed himself in his way as an adversary.He was riding on his she-ass, with his two servants alongside,
p4546
sI23
Vwhen the ass caught sight of the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with his drawn sword in his hand. The ass swerved from the road and went into the fields; and Balaam beat the ass to turn her back onto the road.
p4547
sI24
VThe angel of the Lord then stationed himself in a lane between the vineyards, with a fence on either side.
p4548
sI25
VThe ass, seeing the angel of the Lord, pressed herself against the wall and squeezed Balaam\u2019s foot against the wall; so he beat her again.
p4549
sI26
VOnce more the angel of the Lord moved forward and stationed himself on a spot so narrow that there was no room to swerve right or left.
p4550
sI27
VWhen the ass now saw the angel of the Lord, she lay down under Balaam; and Balaam was furious and beat the ass with his stick.
p4551
sI28
VThen the Lord opened the ass\u2019s mouth, and she said to Balaam, \u201cWhat have I done to you that you have beaten me these three times?\u201d
p4552
sI29
VBalaam said to the ass, \u201cYou have made a mockery of me! If I had a sword with me, I\u2019d kill you.\u201d
p4553
sI30
VThe ass said to Balaam, \u201cLook, I am the ass that you have been riding all along until this day! Have I been in the habit of doing thus to you?\u201d And he answered, \u201cNo.\u201d
p4554
sI31
VThen the Lord uncovered Balaam\u2019s eyes, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, his drawn sword in his hand; thereupon he bowed right down to the ground.
p4555
sI32
VThe angel of the Lord said to him, \u201cWhy have you beaten your ass these three times? It is I who came out as an adversary, for the errand is obnoxious to me.
p4556
sI33
VAnd when the ass saw me, she shied away because of me those three times. If she had not shied away from me, you are the one I should have killed, while sparing her.\u201d
p4557
sI34
VBalaam said to the angel of the Lord, \u201cI erred because I did not know that you were standing in my way. If you still disapprove, I will turn back.\u201d
p4558
sI35
VBut the angel of the Lord said to Balaam, \u201cGo with the men. But you must say nothing except what I tell you.\u201d So Balaam went on with Balak\u2019s dignitaries.
p4559
sI36
VWhen Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at Ir-moab, which is on the Arnon border, at its farthest point.
p4560
sI37
VBalak said to Balaam, \u201cWhen I first sent to invite you, why didn\u2019t you come to me? Am I really unable to reward you?\u201d
p4561
sI38
VBut Balaam said to Balak, \u201cAnd now that I have come to you, have I the power to speak freely? I can utter only the word that God puts into my mouth.\u201d
p4562
sI39
VBalaam went with Balak and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.

VBalak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and had them served to Balaam and the dignitaries with him.

VThen Balak said to Balaam, \u201cWhat have you done to me? Here I brought you to damn my enemies, and instead you have blessed them!\u201d
p4577
sI12
VHe replied, \u201cI can only repeat faithfully what the Lord puts in my mouth.\u201d
p4578

VThen Balak said to him, \u201cCome with me to another place from which you can see them\u2014you will see only a portion of them; you will not see all of them\u2014and damn them for me from there.\u201d

VThe towns that you assign to the Levites shall comprise the six cities of refuge that you are to designate for a manslayer to flee to, to which you shall add forty-two towns.

sI27
VYou sulked in your tents and said, \u201cIt is because the Lord hates us that He brought us out of the land of Egypt, to hand us over to the Amorites to wipe us out.
p5087
sI28
VWhat kind of place are we going to? Our kinsmen have taken the heart out of us, saying, \u2018We saw there a people stronger and taller than we, large cities with walls sky-high, and even Anakites.\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p5088
sI29
VI said to you, \u201cHave no dread or fear of them.
p5089
sI30
VNone other than the Lord your God, who goes before you, will fight for you, just as He did for you in Egypt before your very eyes,
p5090
sI31
Vand in the wilderness, where you saw how the Lord your God carried you, as a man carries his son, all the way that you traveled until you came to this place.
p5091
sI32
VYet for all that, you have no faith in the Lord your God,
p5092
sI33
Vwho goes before you on your journeys\u2014to scout the place where you are to encamp\u2014in fire by night and in cloud by day, in order to guide you on the route you are to follow.\u201d
p5093
sI34
VWhen the Lord heard your loud complaint, He was angry. He vowed:
p5094
sI35
VNot one of these men, this evil generation, shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers\u2014
p5095
sI36
Vnone except Caleb son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and his descendants will I give the land on which he set foot, because he remained loyal to the Lord.
p5096
sI37
VBecause of you the Lord was incensed with me too, and He said: You shall not enter it either.
p5097
sI38
VJoshua son of Nun, who attends you, he shall enter it. Imbue him with strength, for he shall allot it to Israel.
p5098
sI39
VMoreover, your little ones who you said would be carried off, your children who do not yet know good from bad, they shall enter it; to them will I give it and they shall possess it.
p5099
sI40
VAs for you, turn about and march into the wilderness by the way of the Sea of Reeds.
p5100
sI41
VYou replied to me, saying, \u201cWe stand guilty before the Lord. We will go up now and fight, just as the Lord our God commanded us.\u201d And you all girded yourselves with war gear and recklessly started for the hill country.
p5101
sI42
VBut the Lord said to me, \u201cWarn them: Do not go up and do not fight, since I am not in your midst; else you will be routed by your enemies.\u201d
p5102
sI43
VI spoke to you, but you would not listen; you flouted the Lord\u2018s command and willfully marched into the hill country.
p5103
sI44
VThen the Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you like so many bees and chased you, and they crushed you at Hormah in Seir.
p5104
sI45
VAgain you wept before the Lord; but the Lord would not heed your cry or give ear to you.
p5105
ssI2
(dp5106
I1
VThus, after you had remained at Kadesh all that long time,
p5107
sI2
V\ufeff1\ufeffwe marched back into the wilderness by the way of the Sea of Reeds, as the Lord had spoken to me, and skirted the hill country of Seir a long time.
p5108
sI3
VThen the Lord said to me:
p5109
sI4
VYou have been skirting this hill country long enough; now turn north.
p5110
sI5
VAnd charge the people as follows: You will be passing through the territory of your kinsmen, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. Though they will be afraid of you, be very careful
p5111
sI6
Vnot to provoke them. For I will not give you of their land so much as a foot can tread on; I have given the hill country of Seir as a possession to Esau.
p5112
sI7
VWhat food you eat you shall obtain from them for money; even the water you drink you shall procure from them for money.
p5113
sI8
VIndeed, the Lord your God has blessed you in all your undertakings. He has watched over your wanderings through this great wilderness; the Lord your God has been with you these past forty years: you have lacked nothing.
p5114
sI9
VWe then moved on, away from our kinsmen, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the road of the Arabah, away from Elath and Ezion-geber; and we marched on in the direction of the wilderness of Moab.
p5115
sI10
VAnd the Lord said to me: Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war. For I will not give you any of their land as a possession; I have assigned Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot.\u2014
p5116
sI11
VIt was formerly inhabited by the Emim, a people great and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites.
p5117
sI12
VLike the Anakites, they are counted as Rephaim; but the Moabites call them Emim.
p5118
sI13
VSimilarly, Seir was formerly inhabited by the Horites; but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them, wiping them out and settling in their place, just as Israel did in the land they were to possess, which the Lord had given to them.\u2014
p5119
sI14
VUp now! Cross the wadi Zered!So we crossed the wadi Zered.
p5120
sI15
VThe time that we spent in travel from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the wadi Zered was thirty-eight years, until that whole generation of warriors had perished from the camp, as the Lord had sworn concerning them.
p5121
sI16
VIndeed, the hand of the Lord struck them, to root them out from the camp to the last man.
p5122
sI17
VWhen all the warriors among the people had  died off,
p5123
sI18
Vthe Lord spoke to me, saying:
p5124
sI19
VYou are now passing through the territory of Moab, through Ar.
p5125
sI20
VYou will then be close to the Ammonites; do not harass them or start a fight with them. For I will not give any part of the land of the Ammonites to you as a possession; I have assigned it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.\u2014
p5126
sI21
VIt, too, is counted as Rephaim country. It was formerly inhabited by Rephaim, whom the Ammonites call Zamzummim,
p5127
sI22
Va people great and numerous and as tall as the Anakites. The Lord wiped them out, so that [the Ammonites] dispossessed them and settled in their place,
p5128
sI23
Vas He did for the descendants of Esau who live in Seir, when He wiped out the Horites before them, so that they dispossessed them and settled in their place, as is still the case.
p5129
sI24
VSo, too, with the Avvim who dwelt in villages in the vicinity of Gaza: the Caphtorim, who came from Crete, wiped them out and settled in their place.\u2014
p5130
sI25
VUp! Set out across the wadi Arnon! See, I give into your power Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin the occupation: engage him in battle.
p5131
sI26
VThis day I begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under heaven, so that they shall tremble and quake because of you whenever they hear you mentioned.
p5132
sI27
VThen I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to King Sihon of Heshbon with an offer of peace, as follows,
p5133
sI28
V\u201cLet me pass through your country. I will keep strictly to the highway, turning off neither to the right nor to the left.
p5134
sI29
VWhat food I eat you will supply for money, and what water I drink you will furnish for money; just let me pass through\u2014
p5135
sI30
Vas the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir did for me, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar\u2014that I may cross the Jordan into the land that the Lord our God is giving us.\u201d
p5136
sI31
VBut King Sihon of Heshbon refused to let us pass through, because the Lord had stiffened his will and hardened his heart in order to deliver him into your power\u2014as is now the case.
p5137
sI32
VAnd the Lord said to me: See, I begin by placing Sihon and his land at your disposal. Begin the occupation; take possession of his land.
p5138
sI33
VSihon with all his men took the field against us at Jahaz,

Vand the Lord our God delivered him to us and we defeated him and his sons and all his men.
p5140
sI35
VAt that time we captured all his towns, and we doomed every town\u2014men, women, and children\u2014leaving no survivor.
p5141
sI36
VWe retained as booty only the cattle and the spoil of the cities that we captured.
p5142
sI37
VFrom Aroer on the edge of the Arnon valley, including the town in the valley itself, to Gilead, not a city was too mighty for us; the Lord our God delivered everything to us.
p5143
sI38
VBut you did not encroach upon the land of the Ammonites, all along the wadi Jabbok and the towns of the hill country, just as the Lord our God had commanded.
p5144
ssI3
(dp5145
I1
VWe made our way up the road toward Bashan, and King Og of Bashan with all his men took the field against us at Edrei.
p5146
sI2
VBut the Lord said to me: Do not fear him, for I am delivering him and all his men and his country into your power, and you will do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.
p5147
sI3
VSo the Lord our God also delivered into our power King Og of Bashan, with all his men, and we dealt them such a blow that no survivor was left.
p5148
sI4
VAt that time we captured all his towns; there was not a town that we did not take from them: sixty towns, the whole district of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan
p5149
sI5
V\u2014all those towns were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars\u2014apart from a great number of unwalled towns.
p5150
sI6
VWe doomed them as we had done in the case of King Sihon of Heshbon; we doomed every town\u2014men, women, and children\u2014
p5151
sI7
Vand retained as booty all the cattle and the spoil of the towns.
p5152
sI8
VThus we seized, at that time, from the two Amorite kings, the country beyond the Jordan, from the wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon\u2014
p5153
sI9
VSidonians called Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir\u2014
p5154
sI10
Vall the towns of the Tableland and the whole of Gilead and Bashan as far as Salcah and Edrei, the towns of Og\u2019s kingdom in Bashan.
p5155
sI11
VOnly King Og of Bashan was left of the remaining Rephaim. His bedstead, an iron bedstead, is now in Rabbah of the Ammonites; it is nine cubits long and four cubits wide, by the standard cubit!
p5156
sI12
VAnd this is the land which we apportioned at that time: The part from Aroer along the wadi Arnon, with part of the hill country of Gilead and its towns, I assigned to the Reubenites and the Gadites.
p5157
sI13
VThe rest of Gilead, and all of Bashan under Og\u2019s rule\u2014the whole Argob district, all that part of Bashan which is called Rephaim country\u2014I assigned to the half-tribe of Manasseh.
p5158
sI14
VJair son of Manasseh received the whole Argob district (that is, Bashan) as far as the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and named it after himself. Havvoth-jair\u2014as is still the case.
p5159
sI15
VTo Machir I assigned Gilead.
p5160
sI16
VAnd to the Reubenites and the Gadites I assigned the part from Gilead down to the wadi Arnon, the middle of the wadi being the boundary, and up to the wadi Jabbok, the boundary of the Ammonites.
p5161
sI17
V[We also seized] the Arabah, from the foot of the slopes of Pisgah on the east, to the edge of the Jordan, and from Chinnereth down to the sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea.
p5162
sI18
VAt that time I charged you, saying, \u201cThe Lord your God has given you this country to possess. You must go as shock-troops, warriors all, at the head of your Israelite kinsmen.
p5163
sI19
VOnly your wives, children, and livestock\u2014I know that you have much livestock\u2014shall be left in the towns I have assigned to you,
p5164
sI20
Vuntil the Lord has granted your kinsmen a haven such as you have, and they too have taken possession of the land that the Lord your God is assigning them, beyond the Jordan. Then you may return each to the homestead that I have assigned to him.\u201d
p5165
sI21
VI also charged Joshua at that time, saying, \u201cYou have seen with your own eyes all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings; so shall the Lord do to all the kingdoms into which you shall cross over.
p5166
sI22
VDo not fear them, for it is the Lord your God who will battle for you.\u201d\u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05d7\u05e0\u05df
p5167
sI23
VI pleaded with the Lord at that time, saying,

sI24
V\u201cO Lord God, You who let Your servant see the first works of Your greatness and Your mighty hand, You whose powerful deeds no god in heaven or on earth can equal!
p5169
sI25
VLet me, I pray, cross over and see the good land on the other side of the Jordan, that good hill country, and the Lebanon.\u201d
p5170
sI26
VBut the Lord was wrathful with me on your account and would not listen to me. The Lord said to me, \u201cEnough! Never speak to Me of this matter again!
p5171
sI27
VGo up to the summit of Pisgah and gaze about, to the west, the north, the south, and the east. Look at it well, for you shall not go across yonder Jordan.
p5172
sI28
VGive Joshua his instructions, and imbue him with strength and courage, for he shall go across at the head of this people, and he shall allot to them the land that you may only see.\u201d

sI2
VYou shall not add anything to what I command you or take anything away from it, but keep the commandments of the Lord your God that I enjoin upon you.
p5177
sI3
VYou saw with your own eyes what the Lord did in the matter of Baal-peor, that the Lord your God wiped out from among you every person who followed Baal-peor;
p5178
sI4
Vwhile you, who held fast to the Lord your God, are all alive today.
p5179
sI5
VSee, I have imparted to you laws and rules, as the Lord my God has commanded me, for you to abide by in the land that you are about to enter and occupy.
p5180
sI6
VObserve them faithfully, for that will be proof of your wisdom and discernment to other peoples, who on hearing of all these laws will say, \u201cSurely, that great nation is a wise and discerning people.\u201d

VFor what great nation is there that has a god so close at hand as is the Lord our God whenever we call upon Him?

VOr what great nation has laws and rules as perfect as all this Teaching that I set before you this day?
p5183

VBut take utmost care and watch yourselves scrupulously, so that you do not forget the things that you saw with your own eyes and so that they do not fade from your mind as long as you live. And make them known to your children and to your children\u2019s children:
p5184
sI10
VThe day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, when the Lord said to Me, \u201cGather the people to Me that I may let them hear My words, in order that they may learn to revere Me as long as they live on earth, and may so teach their children.\u201d
p5185
sI11
VYou came forward and stood at the foot of the mountain. The mountain was ablaze with flames to the very skies, dark with densest clouds.
p5186
sI12
VThe Lord spoke to you out of the fire; you heard the sound of words but perceived no shape\u2014nothing but a voice.
p5187
sI13
VHe declared to you the covenant that He commanded you to observe, the Ten Commandments; and He inscribed them on two tablets of stone.
p5188
sI14
VAt the same time the Lord commanded me to impart to you laws and rules for you to observe in the land that you are about to cross into and occupy.
p5189
sI15
VFor your own sake, therefore, be most careful\u2014since you saw no shape when the Lord your God spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire\u2014
p5190
sI16
Vnot to act wickedly and make for yourselves a sculptured image in any likeness whatever: the form of a man or a woman,
p5191

Vthe form of any beast on earth, the form of any winged bird that flies in the sky,
p5192
sI18
Vthe form of anything that creeps on the ground, the form of any fish that is in the waters below the earth.
p5193
sI19
VAnd when you look up to the sky and behold the sun and the moon and the stars, the whole heavenly host, you must not be lured into bowing down to them or serving them. These the Lord your God allotted to other peoples everywhere under heaven;
p5194
sI20
Vbut you the Lord took and brought out of Egypt, that iron blast furnace, to be His very own people, as is now the case.
p5195
sI21
VNow the Lord was angry with me on your account and swore that I should not cross the Jordan and enter the good land that the Lord your God is assigning you as a heritage.
p5196
sI22
VFor I must die in this land; I shall not cross the Jordan. But you will cross and take possession of that good land.
p5197
sI23
VTake care, then, not to forget the covenant that the Lord your God concluded with you, and not to make for yourselves a sculptured image in any likeness, against which the Lord your God has enjoined you.

sI24
VFor the Lord your God is a consuming fire, an impassioned God.

sI25
VWhen you have begotten children and children\u2019s children and are long established in the land, should you act wickedly and make for yourselves a sculptured image in any likeness, causing the Lord your God displeasure and vexation,
p5200
sI26
VI call heaven and earth this day to witness against you that you shall soon perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess; you shall not long endure in it, but shall be utterly wiped out.
p5201
sI27
VThe Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and only a scant few of you shall be left among the nations to which the Lord will drive you.
p5202
sI28
VThere you will serve man-made gods of wood and stone, that cannot see or hear or eat or smell.

VBut if you search there for the Lord your God, you will find Him, if only you seek Him with all your heart and soul\u2014

sI30
Vwhen you are in distress because all these things have befallen you and, in the end, return to the Lord your God and obey Him.

sI31
VFor the Lord your God is a compassionate God: He will not fail you nor will He let you perish; He will not forget the covenant which He made on oath with your fathers.
p5206
sI32
VYou have but to inquire about bygone ages that came before you, ever since God created man on earth, from one end of heaven to the other: has anything as grand as this ever happened, or has its like ever been known?
p5207
sI33
VHas any people heard the voice of a god speaking out of a fire, as you have, and survived?
p5208
sI34
VOr has any god ventured to go and take for himself one nation from the midst of another by prodigious acts, by signs and portents, by war, by a mighty and an outstretched arm and awesome power, as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?
p5209
sI35
VIt has been clearly demonstrated to you that the Lord alone is God; there is none beside Him.
p5210
sI36
VFrom the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you; on earth He let you see His great fire; and from amidst that fire you heard His words.
p5211
sI37
VAnd because He loved your fathers, He chose their heirs after them; He Himself, in His great might, led you out of Egypt,
p5212
sI38
Vto drive from your path nations greater and more populous than you, to take you into their land and assign it to you as a heritage, as is still the case.

VYou shall not make for yourself a sculptured image, any likeness of what is in the heavens above, or on the earth below, or in the waters below the earth.

p5239

VThe Lord spoke those words\u2014those and no more\u2014to your whole congregation at the mountain, with a mighty voice out of the fire and the dense clouds. He inscribed them on two tablets of stone, which He gave to me.

Vyou shall set aside three cities in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess.

VYou shall survey the distances, and divide into three parts the territory of the country that the Lord your God has allotted to you, so that any manslayer may have a place to flee to.
p5592
sI4
V\u2014Now this is the case of the manslayer who may flee there and live: one who has killed another unwittingly, without having been his enemy in the past.
p5593
sI5
VFor instance, a man goes with his neighbor into a grove to cut wood; as his hand swings the ax to cut down a tree, the ax-head flies off the handle and strikes the other so that he dies. That man shall flee to one of these cities and live.\u2014
p5594
sI6
VOtherwise, when the distance is great, the blood-avenger, pursuing the manslayer in hot anger, may overtake him and kill him; yet he did not incur the death penalty, since he had never been the other\u2019s enemy.
p5595
sI7
VThat is why I command you: set aside three cities.

VYou shall die on the mountain that you are about to ascend, and shall be gathered to your kin, as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his kin;

VAnd Joshua said to the people, \u201cPurify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will perform wonders in your midst.\u201d
p6102
sI6
VThen Joshua ordered the priests, \u201cTake up the Ark of the Covenant and advance to the head of the people.\u201d And they took up the Ark of the Covenant and marched at the head of the people.

VThe Lord said to Joshua, \u201cThis day, for the first time, I will exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they shall know that I will be with you as I was with Moses.

VFor your part, command the priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant as follows: When you reach the edge of the waters of the Jordan, make a halt in the Jordan.\u201d
p6105

VAnd Joshua said to the Israelites, \u201cCome closer and listen to the words of the Lord your God.
p6106
sI10
VBy this,\u201d Joshua continued, \u201cyou shall know that a living God is among you, and that He will dispossess for you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites:
p6107
sI11
Vthe Ark of the Covenant of the Sovereign of all the earth is advancing before you into the Jordan.
p6108
sI12
VNow select twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe.

sI13
VWhen the feet of the priests bearing the Ark of the Lord, the Sovereign of all the earth, come to rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan\u2014the water coming from upstream\u2014will be cut off and will stand in a single heap.\u201d
p6110
sI14
VWhen the people set out from their encampment to cross the Jordan, the priests bearing the Ark of the Covenant were at the head of the people.
p6111
sI15
VNow the Jordan keeps flowing over its entire bed throughout the harvest season. But as soon as the bearers of the Ark reached the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the Ark dipped into the water at its edge,
p6112
sI16
Vthe waters coming down from upstream piled up in a single heap a great way off, at Adam, the town next to Zarethan; and those flowing away downstream to the Sea of the Arabah (the Dead Sea) ran out completely. So the people crossed near Jericho.
p6113
sI17
VThe priests who bore the Ark of the Lord\u2019s Covenant stood on dry land exactly in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel crossed over on dry land, until the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan.

VWhen the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the Lord said to Joshua,
p6116

V\u201cSelect twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe,
p6117
sI3
Vand instruct them as follows: Pick up twelve stones from the spot exactly in the middle of the Jordan, where the priests\u2019 feet are standing; take them along with you and deposit them in the place where you will spend the night.\u201d
p6118
sI4
VJoshua summoned the twelve men whom he had designated among the Israelites, one from each tribe;
p6119
sI5
Vand Joshua said to them, \u201cWalk up to the Ark of the Lord your God, in the middle of the Jordan, and each of you lift a stone onto his shoulder\u2014corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel.
p6120
sI6
VThis shall serve as a symbol among you: in time to come, when your children ask, \u2018What is the meaning of these stones for you?\u2019
p6121
sI7
Vyou shall tell them, \u2018The waters of the Jordan were cut off because of the Ark of the Lord\u2019s Covenant; when it passed through the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.\u2019 And so these stones shall serve the people of Israel as a memorial for all time.\u201d
p6122
sI8
VThe Israelites did as Joshua ordered. They picked up twelve stones, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel, from the middle of the Jordan\u2014as the Lord had charged Joshua\u2014and they took them along with them to their night encampment and deposited them there.
p6123
sI9
VJoshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, at the spot where the feet of the priests bearing the Ark of the Covenant had stood; and they have remained there to this day.
p6124
sI10
VThe priests who bore the Ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until all the instructions that the Lord had ordered Joshua to convey to the people had been carried out. And so the people speedily crossed over, just as Moses had assured Joshua in his charge to him.
p6125
sI11
VAnd when all the people finished crossing, the Ark of the Lord and the priests advanced to the head of the people.
p6126
sI12
VThe Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh went across armed in the van of the Israelites, as Moses had charged them.
p6127
sI13
VAbout forty thousand shock troops went across, at the instance of the Lord, to the steppes of Jericho for battle.
p6128
sI14
VOn that day the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, so that they revered him all his days as they had revered Moses.
p6129
sI15
VThe Lord said to Joshua,
p6130
sI16
V\u201cCommand the priests who bear the Ark of the Pact to come up out of the Jordan.\u201d
p6131
sI17
VSo Joshua commanded the priests, \u201cCome up out of the Jordan.\u201d
p6132
sI18
VAs soon as the priests who bore the Ark of the Lord\u2019s Covenant came up out of the Jordan, and the feet of the priests stepped onto the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan resumed their course, flowing over its entire bed as before.
p6133
sI19
VThe people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.
p6134
sI20
VAnd Joshua set up in Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken from the Jordan.
p6135
sI21
VHe charged the Israelites as follows: \u201cIn time to come, when your children ask their fathers, \u2018What is the meaning of those stones?\u2019
p6136
sI22
Vtell your children: \u2018Here the Israelites crossed the Jordan on dry land.\u2019
p6137
sI23
VFor the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you crossed, just as the Lord your God did to the Sea of Reeds, which He dried up before us until we crossed.
p6138
sI24
VThus all the peoples of the earth shall know how mighty is the hand of the Lord, and you shall fear the Lord your God always.\u201d
p6139
ssI5
(dp6140
I1
VWhen all the kings of the Amorites on the western side of the Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites near the Sea, heard how the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the sake of the Israelites until they crossed over, they lost heart, and no spirit was left in them because of the Israelites.
p6141
sI2
VAt that time the Lord said to Joshua, \u201cMake flint knives and proceed with a second circumcision of the Israelites.\u201d
p6142
sI3
VSo Joshua had flint knives made, and the Israelites were circumcised at Gibeath-haaraloth.
p6143
sI4
VThis is the reason why Joshua had the circumcision performed: All the people who had come out of Egypt, all the males of military age, had died during the desert wanderings after leaving Egypt.
p6144
sI5
VNow, whereas all the people who came out of Egypt had been circumcised, none of the people born after the exodus, during the desert wanderings, had been circumcised.
p6145
sI6
VFor the Israelites had traveled in the wilderness forty years, until the entire nation\u2014the men of military age who had left Egypt\u2014had perished; because they had not obeyed the Lord, and the Lord had sworn never to let them see the land that the Lord had sworn to their fathers to assign to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
p6146
sI7
VBut He had raised up their sons in their stead; and it was these that Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, not having been circumcised on the way.
p6147
sI8
VAfter the circumcising of the whole nation was completed, they remained where they were, in the camp, until they recovered.
p6148
sI9
VAnd the Lord said to Joshua, \u201cToday I have rolled away from you the disgrace of Egypt.\u201d So that place was called Gilgal, as it still is.
p6149
sI10
VEncamped at Gilgal, in the steppes of Jericho, the Israelites offered the passover sacrifice on the fourteenth day of the month, toward evening.
p6150
sI11
VOn the day after the passover offering, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the country, unleavened bread and parched grain.
p6151
sI12
VOn that same day, when they ate of the produce of the land, the manna ceased. The Israelites got no more manna; that year they ate of the yield of the land of Canaan.
p6152
sI13
VOnce, when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing before him, drawn sword in hand. Joshua went up to him and asked him, \u201cAre you one of us or of our enemies?\u201d
p6153
sI14
VHe replied, \u201cNo, I am captain of the Lord\u2019s host. Now I have come!\u201d Joshua threw himself face down to the ground and, prostrating himself, said to him, \u201cWhat does my lord command his servant?\u201d
p6154
sI15
VThe captain of the Lord\u2019s host answered Joshua, \u201cRemove your sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy.\u201d And Joshua did so.

VNow Jericho was shut up tight because of the Israelites; no one could leave or enter.
p6157
sI2
VThe Lord said to Joshua, \u201cSee, I will deliver Jericho and her king [and her] warriors into your hands.
p6158
sI3
VLet all your troops march around the city and complete one circuit of the city. Do this six days,
p6159
sI4
Vwith seven priests carrying seven ram\u2019s horns preceding the Ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the horns.
p6160
sI5
VAnd when a long blast is sounded on the horn\u2014as soon as you hear that sound of the horn\u2014all the people shall give a mighty shout. Thereupon the city wall will collapse, and the people shall advance, every man straight ahead.\u201d
p6161
sI6
VJoshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, \u201cTake up the Ark of the Covenant, and let seven priests carrying seven ram\u2019s horns precede the Ark of the Lord.\u201d
p6162
sI7
VAnd he instructed the people, \u201cGo forward, march around the city, with the vanguard marching in front of the Ark of the Lord.\u201d
p6163
sI8
VWhen Joshua had instructed the people, the seven priests carrying seven ram\u2019s horns advanced before the Lord, blowing their horns; and the Ark of the Lord\u2019s Covenant followed them.
p6164
sI9
VThe vanguard marched in front of the priests who were blowing the horns, and the rear guard marched behind the Ark, with the horns sounding all the time.
p6165
sI10
VBut Joshua\u2019s orders to the rest of the people were, \u201cDo not shout, do not let your voices be heard, and do not let a sound issue from your lips until the moment that I command you, \u2018Shout!\u2019 Then you shall shout.\u201d
p6166
sI11
VSo he had the Ark of the Lord go around the city and complete one circuit; then they returned to camp and spent the night in camp.
p6167
sI12
VJoshua rose early the next day; and the priests took up the Ark of the Lord,
p6168
sI13
Vwhile the seven priests bearing the seven ram\u2019s horns marched in front of the Ark of the Lord, blowing the horns as they marched. The vanguard marched in front of them, and the rear guard marched behind the Ark of the Lord, with the horns sounding all the time.
p6169
sI14
VAnd so they marched around the city once on the second day and returned to the camp. They did this six days.
p6170
sI15
VOn the seventh day, they rose at daybreak and marched around the city, in the same manner, seven times; that was the only day that they marched around the city seven times.
p6171
sI16
VOn the seventh round, as the priests blew the horns, Joshua commanded the people, \u201cShout! For the Lord has given you the city.
p6172
sI17
VThe city and everything in it are to be proscribed for the Lord; only Rahab the harlot is to be spared, and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers we sent.
p6173
sI18
VBut you must beware of that which is proscribed, or else you will be proscribed: if you take anything from that which is proscribed, you will cause the camp of Israel to be proscribed; you will bring calamity upon it.
p6174
sI19
VAll the silver and gold and objects of copper and iron are consecrated to the Lord; they must go into the treasury of the Lord.\u201d
p6175
sI20
VSo the people shouted when the horns were sounded. When the people heard the sound of the horns, the people raised a mighty shout and the wall collapsed. The people rushed into the city, every man straight in front of him, and they captured the city.
p6176
sI21
VThey exterminated everything in the city with the sword: man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and ass.
p6177
sI22
VBut Joshua bade the two men who had spied out the land, \u201cGo into the harlot\u2019s house and bring out the woman and all that belong to her, as you swore to her.\u201d
p6178
sI23
VSo the young spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father and her mother, her brothers and all that belonged to her\u2014they brought out her whole family and left them outside the camp of Israel.
p6179
sI24
VThey burned down the city and everything in it. But the silver and gold and the objects of copper and iron were deposited in the treasury of the House of the Lord.
p6180
sI25
VOnly Rahab the harlot and her father\u2019s family were spared by Joshua, along with all that belonged to her, and she dwelt among the Israelites\u2014as is still the case. For she had hidden the messengers that Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
p6181
sI26
VAt that time Joshua pronounced this oath: \u201cCursed of the Lord be the man who shall undertake to fortify this city of Jericho: he shall lay its foundations at the cost of his first-born, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest.\u201d
p6182
sI27
VThe Lord was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.
p6183
ssI7
(dp6184
I1
VThe Israelites, however, violated the proscription: Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of that which was proscribed, and the Lord was incensed with the Israelites.
p6185
sI2
VJoshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which lies close to Beth-aven\u2014east of Bethel\u2014with orders to go up and spy out the country. So the men went up and spied out Ai.
p6186
sI3
VThey returned to Joshua and reported to him, \u201cNot all the troops need go up. Let two or three thousand men go and attack Ai; do not trouble all the troops to go up there, for [the people] there are few.\u201d
p6187
sI4
VSo about three thousand of the troops marched up there; but they were routed by the men of Ai.
p6188
sI5
VThe men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, pursuing them outside the gate as far as Shebarim, and cutting them down along the descent. And the heart of the troops sank in utter dismay.
p6189
sI6
VJoshua thereupon rent his clothes. He and the elders of Israel lay until evening with their faces to the ground in front of the Ark of the Lord; and they strewed earth on their heads.
p6190
sI7
V\u201cAh, Lord God!\u201d cried Joshua. \u201cWhy did You lead this people across the Jordan only to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, to be destroyed by them? If only we had been content to remain on the other side of the Jordan!
p6191
sI8
VO Lord, what can I say after Israel has turned tail before its enemies?
p6192
sI9
VWhen the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land hear of this, they will turn upon us and wipe out our very name from the earth. And what will You do about Your great name?\u201d
p6193
sI10
VBut the Lord answered Joshua: \u201cArise! Why do you lie prostrate?
p6194
sI11
VIsrael has sinned! They have broken the covenant by which I bound them. They have taken of the proscribed and put it in their vessels; they have stolen; they have broken faith!
p6195
sI12
VTherefore, the Israelites will not be able to hold their ground against their enemies; they will have to turn tail before their enemies, for they have become proscribed. I will not be with you any more unless you root out from among you what is proscribed.
p6196
sI13
VGo and purify the people. Order them: Purify yourselves for tomorrow. For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Something proscribed is in your midst, O Israel, and you will not be able to stand up to your enemies until you have purged the proscribed from among you.
p6197
sI14
VTomorrow morning you shall present yourselves by tribes. Whichever tribe the Lord indicates shall come forward by clans; the clan that the Lord indicates shall come forward by ancestral houses, and the ancestral house that the Lord indicates shall come forward man by man.
p6198
sI15
VThen he who is indicated for proscription, and all that is his, shall be put to the fire, because he broke the Covenant of the Lord and because he committed an outrage in Israel.\u201d
p6199
sI16
VEarly next morning, Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes; and the tribe of Judah was indicated.
p6200
sI17
VHe then had the clans of Judah come forward, and the clan of Zerah was indicated. Then he had the clan of Zerah come forward by ancestral houses, and Zabdi was indicated.
p6201
sI18
VFinally he had his ancestral house come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was indicated.
p6202
sI19
VThen Joshua said to Achan, \u201cMy son, pay honor to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession to Him. Tell me what you have done; do not hold anything back from me.\u201d
p6203
sI20
VAchan answered Joshua, \u201cIt is true, I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel. This is what I did:
p6204
sI21
VI saw among the spoil a fine Shinar mantle, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, and I coveted them and took them. They are buried in the ground in my tent, with the silver under it.\u201d
p6205
sI22
VJoshua sent messengers, who hurried to the tent; and there it was, buried in his tent, with the silver underneath.
p6206
sI23
VThey took them from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and displayed them before the Lord.
p6207
sI24
VThen Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan son of Zerah\u2014and the silver, the mantle, and the wedge of gold\u2014his sons and daughters, and his ox, his ass, and his flock, and his tent, and all his belongings, and brought them up to the Valley of Achor.
p6208
sI25
VAnd Joshua said, \u201cWhat calamity you have brought upon us! The Lord will bring calamity upon you this day.\u201d And all Israel pelted him with stones. They put them to the fire and stoned them.
p6209
sI26
VThey raised a huge mound of stones over him, which is still there. Then the anger of the Lord subsided. That is why that place was named the Valley of Achor\u2014as is still the case.
p6210

(dp6211

VThe Lord said to Joshua, \u201cDo not be frightened or dismayed. Take all the fighting troops with you, go and march against Ai. See, I will deliver the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land into your hands.
p6212
sI2
VYou shall treat Ai and her king as you treated Jericho and her king; however, you may take the spoil and the cattle as booty for yourselves. Now set an ambush against the city behind it.\u201d
p6213
sI3
VSo Joshua and all the fighting troops prepared for the march on Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand men, valiant warriors, and sent them ahead by night.
p6214
sI4
VHe instructed them as follows: \u201cMind, you are to lie in ambush behind the city; don\u2019t stay too far from the city, and all of you be on the alert.
p6215
sI5
VI and all the troops with me will approach the city; and when they come out against us, as they did the first time, we will flee from them.
p6216
sI6
VThey will come rushing after us until we have drawn them away from the city. They will think, \u2018They are fleeing from us the same as last time\u2019; but while we are fleeing before them,
p6217
sI7
Vyou will dash out from your ambush and seize the city, and the Lord your God will deliver it into your hands.
p6218
sI8
VAnd when you take the city, set it on fire. Do as the Lord has commanded. Mind, I have given you your orders.\u201d
p6219
sI9
VJoshua then sent them off, and they proceeded to the ambush; they took up a position between Ai and Bethel\u2014west of Ai\u2014while Joshua spent the night with the rest of the troops.
p6220
sI10
VEarly in the morning, Joshua mustered the troops; then he and the elders of Israel marched upon Ai at the head of the troops.
p6221
sI11
VAll the fighting force that was with him advanced near the city and encamped to the north of Ai, with a hollow between them and Ai. \u2014
p6222
sI12
VHe selected about five thousand men and stationed them as an ambush between Bethel and Ai, west of the city.
p6223
sI13
VThus the main body of the army was disposed on the north of the city, but the far end of it was on the west. (This was after Joshua had spent the night in the valley.) \u2014
p6224
sI14
VWhen the king of Ai saw them, he and all his people, the inhabitants of the city, rushed out in the early morning to the meeting place, facing the Arabah, to engage the Israelites in battle; for he was unaware that a force was lying in ambush behind the city.
p6225
sI15
VJoshua and all Israel fled in the direction of the wilderness, as though routed by them.
p6226
sI16
VAll the troops in the city gathered to pursue them; pursuing Joshua, they were drawn out of the city.
p6227
sI17
VNot a man was left in Ai or in Bethel who did not go out after Israel; they left the city open while they pursued Israel.
p6228
sI18
VThe Lord then said to Joshua, \u201cHold out the javelin in your hand toward Ai, for I will deliver it into your hands.\u201d So Joshua held out the javelin in his hand toward the city.
p6229
sI19
VAs soon as he held out his hand, the ambush came rushing out of their station. They entered the city and captured it; and they swiftly set fire to the city.
p6230
sI20
VThe men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising to the sky; they had no room for flight in any direction.The people who had been fleeing to the wilderness now became the pursuers.
p6231
sI21
VFor when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city, and that smoke was rising from the city, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai.
p6232
sI22
VNow the other [Israelites] were coming out of the city against them, so that they were between two bodies of Israelites, one on each side of them. They were slaughtered, so that no one escaped or got away.
p6233
sI23
VThe king of Ai was taken alive and brought to Joshua.
p6234
sI24
VWhen Israel had killed all the inhabitants of Ai who had pursued them into the open wilderness, and all of them, to the last man, had fallen by the sword, all the Israelites turned back to Ai and put it to the sword.
p6235
sI25
VThe total of those who fell that day, men and women, the entire population of Ai, came to twelve thousand.
p6236
sI26
VJoshua did not draw back the hand with which he held out his javelin until all the inhabitants of Ai had been exterminated.
p6237
sI27
VHowever, the Israelites took the cattle and the spoil of the city as their booty, in accordance with the instructions that the Lord had given to Joshua.
p6238
sI28
VThen Joshua burned down Ai, and turned it into a mound of ruins for all time, a desolation to this day.
p6239
sI29
VAnd the king of Ai was impaled on a stake until the evening. At sunset, Joshua had the corpse taken down from the stake and it was left lying at the entrance to the city gate. They raised a great heap of stones over it, which is there to this day.
p6240
sI30
VAt that time Joshua built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,
p6241
sI31
Vas Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the Israelites\u2014as is written in the Book of the Teaching of Moses\u2014an altar of unhewn stone upon which no iron had been wielded. They offered on it burnt offerings to the Lord, and brought sacrifices of well-being.
p6242
sI32
VAnd there, on the stones, he inscribed a copy of the Teaching that Moses had written for the Israelites.
p6243
sI33
VAll Israel\u2014stranger and citizen alike\u2014with their elders, officials, and magistrates, stood on either side of the Ark, facing the levitical priests who carried the Ark of the Lord\u2019s Covenant. Half of them faced Mount Gerizim and half of them faced Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded them of old, in order to bless the people of Israel.
p6244
sI34
VAfter that, he read all the words of the Teaching, the blessing and the curse, just as is written in the Book of the Teaching.
p6245
sI35
VThere was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua failed to read in the presence of the entire assembly of Israel, including the women and children and the strangers who accompanied them.

VBut when the inhabitants of Gibeon learned how Joshua had treated Jericho and Ai,

sI6
VAnd so they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, \u201cWe come from a distant land; we propose that you make a pact with us.\u201d
p6253
sI7
VThe men of Israel replied to the Hivites, \u201cBut perhaps you live among us; how then can we make a pact with you?\u201d
p6254
sI8
VThey said to Joshua, \u201cWe will be your subjects.\u201d But Joshua asked them, \u201cWho are you and where do you come from?\u201d
p6255
sI9
VThey replied, \u201cYour servants have come from a very distant country, because of the fame of the Lord your God. For we heard the report of Him: of all that He did in Egypt,
p6256
sI10
Vand of all that He did to the two Amorite kings on the other side of the Jordan, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth.
p6257
sI11
VSo our elders and all the inhabitants of our country instructed us as follows, \u2018Take along provisions for a trip, and go to them and say: We will be your subjects; come make a pact with us.\u2019
p6258
sI12
VThis bread of ours, which we took from our houses as provision, was still hot when we set out to come to you; and see how dry and crumbly it has become.
p6259
sI13
VThese wineskins were new when we filled them, and see how they have cracked. These clothes and sandals of ours are worn out from the very long journey.\u201d
p6260
sI14
VThe men took [their word] because of their provisions, and did not inquire of the Lord.
p6261
sI15
VJoshua established friendship with them; he made a pact with them to spare their lives, and the chieftains of the community gave them their oath.
p6262
sI16
VBut when three days had passed after they made this pact with them, they learned that they were neighbors, living among them.
p6263
sI17
VSo the Israelites set out, and on the third day they came to their towns; these towns were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
p6264
sI18
VBut the Israelites did not attack them, since the chieftains of the community had sworn to them by the Lord, the God of Israel. The whole community muttered against the chieftains,
p6265
sI19
Vbut all the chieftains answered the whole community, \u201cWe swore to them by the Lord, the God of Israel; therefore we cannot touch them.
p6266
sI20
VThis is what we will do to them: We will spare their lives, so that there may be no wrath against us because of the oath that we swore to them.\u201d
p6267
sI21
VAnd the chieftains declared concerning them, \u201cThey shall live!\u201d And they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the whole community, as the chieftains had decreed concerning them.
p6268
sI22
VJoshua summoned them and spoke to them thus: \u201cWhy did you deceive us and tell us you lived very far from us, when in fact you live among us?
p6269
sI23
VTherefore, be accursed! Never shall your descendants cease to be slaves, hewers of wood and drawers of water for the House of my God.\u201d
p6270
sI24
VBut they replied to Joshua, \u201cYou see, your servants had heard that the Lord your God had promised His servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all the inhabitants of the country on your account; so we were in great fear for our lives on your account. That is why we did this thing.
p6271
sI25
VAnd now we are at your mercy; do with us what you consider right and proper.\u201d
p6272
sI26
VAnd he did so; he saved them from being killed by the Israelites.
p6273

VWhen King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem learned that Joshua had captured Ai and proscribed it, treating Ai and its king as he had treated Jericho and its king, and that, moreover, the people of Gibeon had come to terms with Israel and remained among them,
p6276
sI2
Vhe was very frightened. For Gibeon was a large city, like one of the royal cities\u2014in fact, larger than Ai\u2014and all its men were warriors.
p6277
sI3
VSo King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem sent this message to King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon:
p6278
sI4
V\u201cCome up and help me defeat Gibeon; for it has come to terms with Joshua and the Israelites.\u201d
p6279
sI5
VThe five Amorite kings\u2014the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, with all their armies\u2014joined forces and marched on Gibeon, and encamped against it and attacked it.
p6280
sI6
VThe people of Gibeon thereupon sent this message to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: \u201cDo not fail your servants; come up quickly and aid us and deliver us, for all the Amorite kings of the hill country have gathered against us.\u201d
p6281
sI7
VSo Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his whole fighting force, all the trained warriors.
p6282
sI8
VThe Lord said to Joshua, \u201cDo not be afraid of them, for I will deliver them into your hands; not one of them shall withstand you.\u201d
p6283
sI9
VJoshua took them by surprise, marching all night from Gilgal.
p6284
sI10
VThe Lord threw them into a panic before Israel: [Joshua] inflicted a crushing defeat on them at Gibeon, pursued them in the direction of the Beth-horon ascent, and harried them all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.
p6285
sI11
VWhile they were fleeing before Israel down the descent from Beth-horon, the Lord hurled huge stones on them from the sky, all the way to Azekah, and they perished; more perished from the hailstones than were killed by the Israelite weapons.
p6286
sI12
VOn that occasion, when the Lord routed the Amorites before the Israelites, Joshua addressed the Lord; he said in the presence of the Israelites:\u201cStand still, O sun, at Gibeon,O moon, in the Valley of Aijalon!\u201d
p6287
sI13
VAnd the sun stood stillAnd the moon halted,While a nation wreaked judgment on its foes\u2014as is written in the Book of Jashar. Thus the sun halted in midheaven, and did not press on to set, for a whole day;
p6288
sI14
Vfor the Lord fought for Israel. Neither before nor since has there ever been such a day, when the Lord acted on words spoken by a man.
p6289
sI15
VThen Joshua together with all Israel returned to the camp at Gilgal.
p6290
sI16
VMeanwhile, those five kings fled and hid in a cave at Makkedah.
p6291
sI17
VWhen it was reported to Joshua that the five kings had been found hiding in a cave at Makkedah,
p6292
sI18
VJoshua ordered, \u201cRoll large stones up against the mouth of the cave, and post men over it to keep guard over them.
p6293
sI19
VBut as for the rest of you, don\u2019t stop, but press on the heels of your enemies and harass them from the rear. Don\u2019t let them reach their towns, for the Lord your God has delivered them into your hands.\u201d
p6294
sI20
VWhen Joshua and the Israelites had finished dealing them a deadly blow, they were wiped out, except for some fugitives who escaped into the fortified towns.
p6295
sI21
VThe whole army returned in safety to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah; no one so much as snarled at the Israelites.
p6296
sI22
VAnd now Joshua ordered, \u201cOpen the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me.\u201d
p6297
sI23
VThis was done. Those five kings\u2014the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon\u2014were brought out to him from the cave.
p6298
sI24
VAnd when the kings were brought out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and ordered the army officers who had accompanied him, \u201cCome forward and place your feet on the necks of these kings.\u201d They came forward and placed their feet on their necks.
p6299
sI25
VJoshua said to them, \u201cDo not be frightened or dismayed; be firm and resolute. For this is what the Lord is going to do to all the enemies with whom you are at war.\u201d
p6300
sI26
VAfter that, Joshua had them put to death and impaled on five stakes, and they remained impaled on the stakes until evening.
p6301
sI27
VAt sunset Joshua ordered them taken down from the poles and thrown into the cave in which they had hidden. Large stones were placed over the mouth of the cave, [and there they are] to this very day.
p6302
sI28
VAt that time Joshua captured Makkedah and put it and its king to the sword, proscribing it and every person in it and leaving none that escaped. And he treated the king of Makkedah as he had treated the king of Jericho.
p6303
sI29
VFrom Makkedah, Joshua proceeded with all Israel to Libnah, and he attacked it.
p6304
sI30
VThe Lord delivered it and its king into the hands of Israel; they put it and all the people in it to the sword, letting none escape. And he treated its king as he had treated the king of Jericho.
p6305
sI31
VFrom Libnah, Joshua proceeded with all Israel to Lachish; he encamped against it and attacked it.
p6306
sI32
VThe Lord delivered Lachish into the hands of Israel. They captured it on the second day and put it and all the people in it to the sword, just as they had done to Libnah.
p6307
sI33
VAt that time King Horam of Gezer marched to the help of Lachish; but Joshua defeated him and his army, letting none of them escape.
p6308
sI34
VFrom Lachish, Joshua proceeded with all Israel to Eglon; they encamped against it and attacked it.

sI35
VThey captured it on the same day and put it to the sword, proscribing all the people that were in it, as they had done to Lachish.
p6310
sI36
VFrom Eglon, Joshua marched with all Israel to Hebron and attacked it.
p6311
sI37
VThey captured it and put it, its king, and all its towns, and all the people that were in it, to the sword. He let none escape, proscribing it and all the people in it, just as he had done in the case of Eglon.
p6312
sI38
VJoshua and all Israel with him then turned back to Debir and attacked it.
p6313
sI39
VHe captured it and its king and all its towns. They put them to the sword and proscribed all the people in it. They let none escape; just as they had done to Hebron, and as they had done to Libnah and its king, so they did to Debir and its king.
p6314
sI40
VThus Joshua conquered the whole country: the hill country, the Negeb, the Shephelah, and the slopes, with all their kings; he let none escape, but proscribed everything that breathed\u2014as the Lord, the God of Israel, had commanded.
p6315
sI41
VJoshua conquered them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, all the land of Goshen, and up to Gibeon.

V\u201cIf you are a numerous people,\u201d Joshua answered them, \u201cgo up to the forest country and clear an area for yourselves there, in the territory of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, seeing that you are cramped in the hill country of Ephraim.\u201d

VManasseh did not dispossess [the inhabitants of] Beth-shean and its dependencies, or [of] Taanach and its dependencies, or the inhabitants of Dor and its dependencies, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its dependencies, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its dependencies.

VAnd when Israel gained the upper hand, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor; but they did not dispossess them.

VNor did Ephraim dispossess the Canaanites who inhabited Gezer; so the Canaanites dwelt in their midst at Gezer.

VTherefore, I have resolved not to drive them out before you; they shall become your oppressors, and their gods shall be a snare to you.\u201d

VAnd the Israelites did what was offensive to the Lord. They worshiped the Baalim

Vand forsook the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They followed other gods, from among the gods of the peoples around them, and bowed down to them; they provoked the Lord.

VThey forsook the Lord and worshiped Baal and the Ashtaroth.

VThen the Lord was incensed at Israel, and He handed them over to foes who plundered them. He surrendered them to their enemies on all sides, and they could no longer hold their own against their enemies.

VIn all their campaigns, the hand of the Lord was against them to their undoing, as the Lord had declared and as the Lord had sworn to them; and they were in great distress.

VThen the Lord raised up chieftains who delivered them from those who plundered them.

sI17
VBut they did not heed their chieftains either; they went astray after other gods and bowed down to them. They were quick to turn aside from the way their fathers had followed in obedience to the commandments of the Lord; they did not do right.
p6784
sI18
VWhen the Lord raised up chieftains for them, the Lord would be with the chieftain and would save them from their enemies during the chieftain\u2019s lifetime; for the Lord would be moved to pity by their moanings because of those who oppressed and crushed them.
p6785
sI19

VThe Israelites settled among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites;

sI11
Vand the land had peace for forty years.When Othniel the Kenizzite died,

VThe Israelites were subject to King Eglon of Moab for eighteen years.
p6805
sI15
VThen the Israelites cried out to the Lord, and the Lord raised up a champion for them: the Benjaminite Ehud son of Gera, a left-handed man. It happened that the Israelites sent tribute to King Eglon of Moab through him.
p6806
sI16
VSo Ehud made for himself a two-edged dagger, a gomed in length, which he girded on his right side under his cloak.

sI17
VHe presented the tribute to King Eglon of Moab. Now Eglon was a very stout man.

p6811
sI21
VReaching with his left hand, Ehud drew the dagger from his right side and drove it into [Eglon\u2019s] belly.
p6812
sI22
VThe fat closed over the blade and the hilt went in after the blade\u2014for he did not pull the dagger out of his belly\u2014and the filth came out.
p6813
sI23
VStepping out into the vestibule, Ehud shut the doors of the upper chamber on him and locked them.
p6814
sI24
VAfter he left, the courtiers returned. When they saw that the doors of the upper chamber were locked, they thought, \u201cHe must be relieving himself in the cool chamber.\u201d
p6815
sI25
VThey waited a long time; and when he did not open the doors of the chamber, they took the key and opened them\u2014and there their master was lying dead on the floor!
p6816
sI26
VBut Ehud had made good his escape while they delayed; he had passed Pesilim and escaped to Seirah.
p6817
sI27
VWhen he got there, he had the ram\u2019s horn sounded through the hill country of Ephraim, and all the Israelites descended with him from the hill country; and he took the lead.
p6818
sI28
V\u201cFollow me closely,\u201d he said, \u201cfor the Lord has delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hands.\u201d They followed him down and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites; they let no one cross.

VOn that occasion they slew about 10,000 Moabites; they were all robust and brave men, yet not one of them escaped.

VAnd the Lord surrendered them to King Jabin of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. His army commander was Sisera, whose base was Harosheth-goiim.

VShe used to sit under the Palm of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites would come to her for decisions.
p6828
sI6
VShe summoned Barak son of Abinoam, of Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, \u201cThe Lord, the God of Israel, has commanded: Go, march up to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun.

sI10
VBarak then mustered Zebulun and Naphtali at Kedesh; ten thousand men marched up after him; and Deborah also went up with him.
p6833

VNow Heber the Kenite had separated from the other Kenites, descendants of Hobab, father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent at Elon-bezaanannim, which is near Kedesh.

p6836

VThen Deborah said to Barak, \u201cUp! This is the day on which the Lord will deliver Sisera into your hands: the Lord is marching before you.\u201d Barak charged down Mount Tabor, followed by the ten thousand men,

VSisera, meanwhile, had fled on foot to the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was friendship between King Jabin of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite.
p6840
sI18
VJael came out to greet Sisera and said to him, \u201cCome in, my lord, come in here, do not be afraid.\u201d So he entered her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.
p6841
sI19
VHe said to her, \u201cPlease let me have some water; I am thirsty.\u201d She opened a skin of milk and gave him some to drink; and she covered him again.

VHe said to her, \u201cStand at the entrance of the tent. If anybody comes and asks you if there is anybody here, say \u2018No.\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p6843

VThen Jael wife of Heber took a tent pin and grasped the mallet. When he was fast asleep from exhaustion, she approached him stealthily and drove the pin through his temple till it went down to the ground. Thus he died.
p6844
sI22
VNow Barak appeared in pursuit of Sisera. Jael went out to greet him and said, \u201cCome, I will show you the man you are looking for.\u201d He went inside with her, and there Sisera was lying dead, with the pin in his temple.

VAll Midian, Amalek, and the Kedemites joined forces; they crossed over and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel.

sI34
VThe spirit of the Lord enveloped Gideon; he sounded the horn, and the Abiezrites rallied behind him.
p6914
sI35
VAnd he sent messengers throughout Manasseh, and they too rallied behind him. He then sent messengers through Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet the Manassites.
p6915
sI36
VAnd Gideon said to God, \u201cIf You really intend to deliver Israel through me as You have said\u2014
p6916
sI37
Vhere I place a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If dew falls only on the fleece and all the ground remains dry, I shall know that You will deliver Israel through me, as You have said.\u201d
p6917
sI38
VAnd that is what happened. Early the next day, he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew from the fleece, a bowlful of water.
p6918
sI39
VThen Gideon said to God, \u201cDo not be angry with me if I speak just once more. Let me make just one more test with the fleece: let the fleece alone be dry, while there is dew all over the ground.\u201d
p6919
sI40
VGod did so that night: only the fleece was dry, while there was dew all over the ground.

VEarly next day, Jerubbaal\u2014that is, Gideon\u2014and all the troops with him encamped above En-harod, while the camp of Midian was in the plain to the north of him, at Gibeath-moreh.
p6922
sI2
VThe Lord said to Gideon, \u201cYou have too many troops with you for Me to deliver Midian into their hands; Israel might claim for themselves the glory due to Me, thinking, \u2018Our own hand has brought us victory.\u2019
p6923
sI3
VTherefore, announce to the men, \u2018Let anybody who is timid and fearful turn back, as a bird flies from Mount Gilead.\u2019\ufeff\u201d Thereupon, 22,000 of the troops turned back and 10,000 remained.
p6924
sI4
V\u201cThere are still too many troops,\u201d the Lord said to Gideon. \u201cTake them down to the water and I will sift them for you there. Anyone of whom I tell you, \u2018This one is to go with you,\u2019 that one shall go with you; and anyone of whom I tell you, \u2018This one is not to go with you,\u2019 that one shall not go.\u201d
p6925
sI5
VSo he took the troops down to the water. Then the Lord said to Gideon, \u201cSet apart all those who lap up the water with their tongues like dogs from all those who get down on their knees to drink.\u201d
p6926
sI6
VNow those who \u201clapped\u201d the water into their mouths by hand numbered three hundred; all the rest of the troops got down on their knees to drink.
p6927
sI7
VThen the Lord said to Gideon, \u201cI will deliver you and I will put Midian into your hands through the three hundred \u2018lappers\u2019; let the rest of the troops go home.\u201d
p6928
sI8
VSo [the lappers] took the provisions and horns that the other men had with them, and he sent the rest of the men of Israel back to their homes, retaining only the three hundred men.The Midianite camp was below him, in the plain.
p6929
sI9
VThat night the Lord said to him, \u201cCome, attack the camp, for I have delivered it into your hands.
p6930
sI10
VAnd if you are afraid to attack, first go down to the camp with your attendant Purah
p6931
sI11
Vand listen to what they say; after that you will have the courage to attack the camp.\u201d So he went down with his attendant Purah to the outposts of the warriors who were in the camp.\u2014
p6932
sI12
VNow Midian, Amalek, and all the Kedemites were spread over the plain, as thick as locusts; and their camels were countless, as numerous as the sands on the seashore.\u2014
p6933
sI13
VGideon came there just as one man was narrating a dream to another. \u201cListen,\u201d he was saying, \u201cI had this dream: There was a commotion\u2014a loaf of barley bread was whirling through the Midianite camp. It came to a tent and struck it, and it fell; it turned it upside down, and the tent collapsed.\u201d
p6934
sI14
VTo this the other responded, \u201cThat can only mean the sword of the Israelite Gideon son of Joash. God is delivering Midian and the entire camp into his hands.\u201d
p6935
sI15
VWhen Gideon heard the dream told and interpreted, he bowed low. Returning to the camp of Israel, he shouted, \u201cCome on! The Lord has delivered the Midianite camp into your hands!\u201d
p6936
sI16
VHe divided the three hundred men into three columns and equipped every man with a ram\u2019s horn and an empty jar, with a torch in each jar.
p6937
sI17
V\u201cWatch me,\u201d he said, \u201cand do the same. When I get to the outposts of the camp, do exactly as I do.
p6938
sI18
VWhen I and all those with me blow our horns, you too, all around the camp, will blow your horns and shout, \u2018For the Lord and for Gideon!\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p6939
sI19
VGideon and the hundred men with him arrived at the outposts of the camp, at the beginning of the middle watch, just after the sentries were posted. They sounded the horns and smashed the jars that they had with them,
p6940
sI20
Vand the three columns blew their horns and broke their jars. Holding the torches in their left hands and the horns for blowing in their right hands, they shouted, \u201cA sword for the Lord and for Gideon!\u201d
p6941
sI21
VThey remained standing where they were, surrounding the camp; but the entire camp ran about yelling, and took to flight.
p6942
sI22
VFor when the three hundred horns were sounded, the Lord turned every man\u2019s sword against his fellow, throughout the camp, and the entire host fled as far as Beth-shittah and on to Zererah\u2014as far as the outskirts of Abel-meholah near Tabbath.
p6943
sI23
VAnd now the men of Israel from Naphtali and Asher and from all of Manasseh rallied for the pursuit of the Midianites.
p6944
sI24
VGideon also sent messengers all through the hill country of Ephraim with this order: \u201cGo down ahead of the Midianites and seize their access to the water all along the Jordan down to Beth-barah.\u201d So all the men of Ephraim rallied and seized the waterside down to Beth-barah by the Jordan.
p6945
sI25
VThey pursued the Midianites and captured Midian\u2019s two generals, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and they killed Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb from the other side of the Jordan to Gideon.

VAnd the men of Ephraim said to him, \u201cWhy did you do that to us\u2014not calling us when you went to fight the Midianites?\u201d And they rebuked him severely.
p6948
sI2
VBut he answered them, \u201cAfter all, what have I accomplished compared to you? Why, Ephraim\u2019s gleanings are better than Abiezer\u2019s vintage!
p6949
sI3
VGod has delivered the Midianite generals Oreb and Zeeb into your hands, and what was I able to do compared to you?\u201d And when he spoke in this fashion, their anger against him abated.
p6950
sI4
VGideon came to the Jordan and crossed it. The three hundred men with him were famished, but still in pursuit.
p6951
sI5
VHe said to the people of Succoth, \u201cPlease give some loaves of bread to the men who are following me, for they are famished, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.\u201d
p6952
sI6
VBut the officials of Succoth replied, \u201cAre Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hands, that we should give bread to your troops?\u201d
p6953
sI7
V\u201cI swear,\u201d declared Gideon, \u201cwhen the Lord delivers Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands, I\u2019ll thresh your bodies upon desert thorns and briers!\u201d
p6954
sI8
VFrom there he went up to Penuel and made the same request of them; but the people of Penuel gave him the same reply as the people of Succoth.
p6955
sI9
VSo he also threatened the people of Penuel: \u201cWhen I come back safe, I\u2019ll tear down this tower!\u201d
p6956
sI10
VNow Zebah and Zalmunna were at Karkor with their army of about 15,000; these were all that remained of the entire host of the Kedemites, for the slain numbered 120,000 fighting men.
p6957
sI11
VGideon marched up the road of the tent dwellers, up to east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and routed the camp, which was off guard.
p6958
sI12
VZebah and Zalmunna took to flight, with Gideon in pursuit. He captured Zebah and Zalmunna, the two kings of Midian, and threw the whole army into panic.
p6959
sI13
VOn his way back from the battle at the Ascent of Heres, Gideon son of Joash
p6960
sI14
Vcaptured a boy from among the people of Succoth and interrogated him. The latter drew up for him a list of the officials and elders of Succoth, seventy-seven in number.
p6961
sI15
VThen he came to the people of Succoth and said, \u201cHere are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you mocked me, saying, \u2018Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hands,  that we should give your famished men bread?\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p6962
sI16
VAnd he took the elders of the city and, [bringing] desert thorns and briers, he punished the people of Succoth with them.
p6963
sI17
VAs for Penuel, he tore down its tower and killed the townspeople.
p6964
sI18
VThen he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, \u201cThose men you killed at Tabor, what were they like?\u201d \u201cThey looked just like you,\u201d they replied, \u201clike sons of a king.\u201d
p6965
sI19
V\u201cThey were my brothers,\u201d he declared, \u201cthe sons of my mother. As the Lord lives, if you had spared them, I would not kill you.\u201d
p6966
sI20
VAnd he commanded his oldest son Jether, \u201cGo kill them!\u201d But the boy did not draw his sword, for he was timid, being still a boy.
p6967
sI21
VThen Zebah and Zalmunna said, \u201cCome, you slay us; for strength comes with manhood.\u201d So Gideon went over and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescents that were on the necks of their camels.
p6968
sI22
VThen the men of Israel said to Gideon, \u201cRule over us\u2014you, your son, and your grandson as well; for you have saved us from the Midianites.\u201d
p6969
sI23
VBut Gideon replied, \u201cI will not rule over you myself, nor shall my son rule over you; the Lord alone shall rule over you.\u201d
p6970
sI24
VAnd Gideon said to them, \u201cI have a request to make of you: Each of you give me the earring he received as booty.\u201d (They had golden earrings, for they were Ishmaelites.)
p6971
sI25
V\u201cCertainly!\u201d they replied. And they spread out a cloth, and everyone threw onto it the earring he had received as booty.
p6972
sI26
VThe weight of the golden earrings that he had requested came to 1,700 shekels of gold; this was in addition to the crescents and the pendants and the purple robes worn by the kings of Midian and in addition to the collars on the necks of their camels.
p6973
sI27
VGideon made an ephod of this gold and set it up in his own town of Ophrah. There all Israel went astray after it, and it became a snare to Gideon and his household.
p6974
sI28
VThus Midian submitted to the Israelites and did not raise its head again; and the land was tranquil for forty years in Gideon\u2019s time.
p6975
sI29
VSo Jerubbaal son of Joash retired to his own house.
p6976
sI30
VGideon had seventy sons of his own issue, for he had many wives.

VA son was also born to him by his concubine in Shechem, and he named him Abimelech.
p6978
sI32
VGideon son of Joash died at a ripe old age, and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash at Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
p6979
sI33
VAfter Gideon died, the Israelites again went astray after the Baalim, and they adopted Baal-berith as a god.
p6980
sI34
VThe Israelites gave no thought to the Lord their God, who saved them from all the enemies around them.

VAbimelech son of Jerubbaal went to his mother\u2019s brothers in Shechem and spoke to them and to the whole clan of his mother\u2019s family. He said,
p6984
sI2
V\u201cPut this question to all the citizens of Shechem: Which is better for you, to be ruled by seventy men\u2014by all the sons of Jerubbaal\u2014or to be ruled by one man? And remember, I am your own flesh and blood.\u201d
p6985
sI3
VHis mother\u2019s brothers said all this in his behalf to all the citizens of Shechem, and they were won over to Abimelech; for they thought, \u201cHe is our kinsman.\u201d
p6986
sI4
VThey gave him seventy shekels from the temple of Baal-berith; and with this Abimelech hired some worthless and reckless fellows, and they followed him.
p6987
sI5
VThen he went to his father\u2019s house in Ophrah and killed his brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men on one stone. Only Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived, because he went into hiding.
p6988

VAll the citizens of Shechem and all Beth-millo convened, and they proclaimed Abimelech king at the terebinth of the pillar at Shechem.

V\u201cOnce the trees went to anoint a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree, \u2018Reign over us.\u2019
p6991

VBut the olive tree replied, \u2018Have I, through whom God and men are honored, stopped yielding my rich oil, that I should go and wave above the trees?\u2019
p6992
sI10
VSo the trees said to the fig tree, \u2018You come and reign over us.\u2019

VAbimelech held sway over Israel for three years.

sI23
VThen God sent a spirit of discord between Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem, and the citizens of Shechem broke faith with Abimelech\u2014
p7006

Vto the end that the crime committed against the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be avenged, and their blood recoil upon their brother Abimelech, who had slain them, and upon the citizens of Shechem, who had abetted him in the slaying of his brothers.

sI25
VThe citizens of Shechem planted ambuscades against him on the hilltops; and they robbed whoever passed by them on the road. Word of this reached Abimelech.

VThen Gaal son of Ebed and his companions came passing through Shechem, and the citizens of Shechem gave him their confidence.
p7009
sI27
VThey went out into the fields, gathered and trod out the vintage of their vineyards, and made a festival. They entered the temple of their god, and as they ate and drank they reviled Abimelech.
p7010
sI28
VGaal son of Ebed said, \u201cWho is Abimelech and who are [we] Shechemites, that we should serve him? This same son of Jerubbaal and his lieutenant Zebul once served the men of Hamor, the father of Shechem; so why should we serve him?
p7011
sI29
VOh, if only this people were under my command, I would get rid of Abimelech! One would challenge Abimelech, \u2018Fill up your ranks and come out here!\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p7012
sI30
VWhen Zebul, the governor of the city, heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he was furious.

VHe sent messages to Abimelech at Tormah to say, \u201cGaal son of Ebed and his companions have come to Shechem and they are inciting the city against you.
p7014
sI32
VTherefore, set out at night with the forces you have with you and conceal yourself in the fields.
p7015
sI33
VEarly next morning, as the sun rises, advance on the city. He and his men will thereupon come out against you, and you will do to him whatever you find possible.\u201d
p7016

VAbimelech and all the men with him set out at night and disposed themselves against Shechem in four hiding places.

sI35
VWhen Gaal son of Ebed came out and stood at the entrance to the city gate, Abimelech and the army with him emerged from concealment.
p7018
sI36
VGaal saw the army and said to Zebul, \u201cThat\u2019s an army marching down from the hilltops!\u201d But Zebul said to him, \u201cThe shadows of the hills look to you like men.\u201d
p7019
sI37
VGaal spoke up again, \u201cLook, an army is marching down from Tabbur-erez, and another column is coming from the direction of Elon-meonenim.\u201d
p7020
sI38
V\u201cWell,\u201d replied Zebul, \u201cwhere is your boast, \u2018Who is Abimelech that we should serve him\u2019? There is the army you sneered at; now go out and fight it!\u201d
p7021
sI39
VSo Gaal went out at the head of the citizens of Shechem and gave battle to Abimelech.
p7022
sI40
VBut he had to flee before him, and Abimelech pursued him, and many fell slain, all the way to the entrance of the gate.
p7023
sI41
VThen Abimelech stayed in Arumah, while Zebul expelled Gaal and his companions and kept them out of Shechem.
p7024
sI42
VThe next day, when people went out into the fields, Abimelech was informed.
p7025
sI43
VTaking the army, he divided it into three columns and lay in ambush in the fields; and when he saw the people coming out of the city, he pounced upon them and struck them down.
p7026
sI44
VWhile Abimelech and the column that followed him dashed ahead and took up a position at the entrance of the city gate, the other two columns rushed upon all that were in the open and struck them down.

VAbimelech fought against the city all that day. He captured the city and massacred the people in it; he razed the town and sowed it with salt.

VWhen all the citizens of the Tower of Shechem learned of this, they went into the tunnel of the temple of El-berith.

sI47
VWhen Abimelech was informed that all the citizens of the Tower of Shechem had gathered [there],
p7030
sI48
VAbimelech and all the troops he had with him went up on Mount Zalmon. Taking an ax in his hand, Abimelech lopped off a tree limb and lifted it onto his shoulder. Then he said to the troops that accompanied him, \u201cWhat you saw me do\u2014quick, do the same!\u201d
p7031
sI49
VSo each of the troops also lopped off a bough; then they marched behind Abimelech and laid them against the tunnel, and set fire to the tunnel over their heads. Thus all the people of the Tower of Shechem also perished, about a thousand men and women.
p7032
sI50
VAbimelech proceeded to Thebez; he encamped at Thebez and occupied it.
p7033
sI51
VWithin the town was a fortified tower; and all the citizens of the town, men and women, took refuge there. They shut themselves in, and went up on the roof of the tower.
p7034
sI52
VAbimelech pressed forward to the tower and attacked it. He approached the door of the tower to set it on fire.
p7035
sI53
VBut a woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech\u2019s head and cracked his skull.
p7036
sI54
VHe immediately cried out to his attendant, his arms-bearer, \u201cDraw your dagger and finish me off, that they may not say of me, \u2018A woman killed him!\u2019\ufeff\u201d So his attendant stabbed him, and he died.
p7037
sI55
VWhen the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, everyone went home.
p7038
sI56
VThus God repaid Abimelech for the evil he had done to his father by slaying his seventy brothers;

VThe Sidonians, Amalek, and Maon also oppressed you; and when you cried out to Me, I saved you from them.

VJephthah the Gileadite was an able warrior, who was the son of a prostitute. Jephthah\u2019s father was Gilead;
p7061
sI2
Vbut Gilead also had sons by his wife, and when the wife\u2019s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out. They said to him, \u201cYou shall have no share in our father\u2019s property, for you are the son of an outsider.\u201d
p7062
sI3
VSo Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the Tob country. Men of low character gathered about Jephthah and went out raiding with him.
p7063
sI4
VSome time later, the Ammonites went to war against Israel.
p7064
sI5
VAnd when the Ammonites attacked Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah back from the Tob country.
p7065
sI6
VThey said to Jephthah, \u201cCome be our chief, so that we can fight the Ammonites.\u201d
p7066
sI7
VJephthah replied to the elders of Gilead, \u201cYou are the very people who rejected me and drove me out of my father\u2019s house. How can you come to me now when you are in trouble?\u201d
p7067
sI8
VThe elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, \u201cHonestly, we have now turned back to you. If you come with us and fight the Ammonites, you shall be our commander over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\u201d
p7068
sI9
VJephthah said to the elders of Gilead, \u201c[Very well,] if you bring me back to fight the Ammonites and the Lord delivers them to me, I am to be your commander.\u201d
p7069
sI10
VAnd the elders of Gilead answered Jepthah, \u201cThe Lord Himself shall be witness between us: we will do just as you have said.\u201d
p7070
sI11
VJephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him their commander and chief. And Jephthah repeated all these terms before the Lord at Mizpah.
p7071
sI12
VJephthah then sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, saying, \u201cWhat have you against me that you have come to make war on my country?\u201d
p7072
sI13
VThe king of the Ammonites replied to Jephthah\u2019s messengers, \u201cWhen Israel came from Egypt, they seized the land which is mine, from the Arnon to the Jabbok as far as the Jordan. Now, then, restore it peaceably.\u201d
p7073
sI14
VJephthah again sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites.
p7074
sI15
VHe said to him, \u201cThus said Jephthah: Israel did not seize the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites.
p7075
sI16
VWhen they left Egypt, Israel traveled through the wilderness to the Sea of Reeds and went on to Kadesh.
p7076
sI17
VIsrael then sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, \u2018Allow us to cross your country.\u2019 But the king of Edom would not consent. They also sent a mission to the king of Moab, and he refused. So Israel, after staying at Kadesh,
p7077
sI18
Vtraveled on through the wilderness, skirting the land of Edom and the land of Moab. They kept to the east of the land of Moab until they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; and, since Moab ends at the Arnon, they never entered Moabite territory.
p7078
sI19
V\u201cThen Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon. Israel said to him, \u2018Allow us to cross through your country to our homeland.\u2019
p7079
sI20
VBut Sihon would not trust Israel to pass through his territory. Sihon mustered all his troops, and they encamped at Jahaz; he engaged Israel in battle.
p7080
sI21
VBut the Lord, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his troops into Israel\u2019s hands, and they defeated them; and Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that land.
p7081
sI22
VThus they possessed all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
p7082
sI23
V\u201cNow, then, the Lord, the God of Israel, dispossessed the Amorites before His people Israel; and should you possess their land?
p7083
sI24
VDo you not hold what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So we will hold on to everything that the Lord our God has given us to possess.

sI25
V\u201cBesides, are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he start a quarrel with Israel or go to war with them?
p7085
sI26
V\u201cWhile Israel has been inhabiting Heshbon and its dependencies, and Aroer and its dependencies, and all the towns along the Arnon for three hundred years, why have you not tried to recover them all this time?

VI have done you no wrong; yet you are doing me harm and making war on me. May the Lord, who judges, decide today between the Israelites and the Ammonites!\u201d
p7087
sI28
VBut the king of the Ammonites paid no heed to the message that Jephthah sent him.
p7088
sI29
VThen the spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah. He marched through Gilead and Manasseh, passing Mizpeh of Gilead; and from Mizpeh of Gilead he crossed over [to] the Ammonites.
p7089
sI30
VAnd Jephthah made the following vow to the Lord: \u201cIf you deliver the Ammonites into my hands,
p7090
sI31
Vthen whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me on my safe return from the Ammonites shall be the Lord\u2019s and shall be offered by me as a burnt offering.\u201d
p7091
sI32
VJephthah crossed over to the Ammonites and attacked them, and the Lord delivered them into his hands.
p7092
sI33
VHe utterly routed them\u2014from Aroer as far as Minnith, twenty towns\u2014all the way to Abel-cheramim. So the Ammonites submitted to the Israelites.
p7093
sI34
VWhen Jephthah arrived at his home in Mizpah, there was his daughter coming out to meet him, with timbrel and dance! She was an only child; he had no other son or daughter.
p7094
sI35
VOn seeing her, he rent his clothes and said, \u201cAlas, daughter! You have brought me low; you have become my troubler! For I have uttered a vow to the Lord and I cannot retract.\u201d
p7095
sI36
V\u201cFather,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have uttered a vow to the Lord; do to me as you have vowed, seeing that the Lord has vindicated you against your enemies, the Ammonites.\u201d
p7096
sI37
VShe further said to her father, \u201cLet this be done for me: let me be for two months, and I will go with my companions and lament upon the hills and there bewail my maidenhood.\u201d
p7097
sI38
V\u201cGo,\u201d he replied. He let her go for two months, and she and her companions went and bewailed her maidenhood upon the hills.
p7098
sI39
VAfter two months\u2019 time, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. She had never known a man. So it became a custom in Israel

Vfor the maidens of Israel to go every year, for four days in the year, and chant dirges for the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.

VThe men of Ephraim mustered and crossed [the Jordan] to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, \u201cWhy did you march to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We\u2019ll burn your house down over you!\u201d
p7102
sI2
VJephthah answered them, \u201cI and my people were in a bitter conflict with the Ammonites; and I summoned you, but you did not save me from them.
p7103
sI3
VWhen I saw that you were no saviors, I risked my life and advanced against the Ammonites; and the Lord delivered them into my hands. Why have you come here now to fight against me?\u201d
p7104
sI4
VAnd Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought the Ephraimites. The men of Gilead defeated the Ephraimites; for they had said, \u201cYou Gileadites are nothing but fugitives from Ephraim\u2014being in Manasseh is like being in Ephraim.\u201d
p7105
sI5
VThe Gileadites held the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And when any fugitive from Ephraim said, \u201cLet me cross,\u201d the men of Gilead would ask him, \u201cAre you an Ephraimite?\u201d; if he said \u201cNo,\u201d
p7106
sI6
Vthey would say to him, \u201cThen say shibboleth\u201c; but he would say \u201csibboleth,\u201d not being able to pronounce it correctly. Thereupon they would seize him and slay him by the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites fell at that time.

VManoah said to the angel of the Lord, \u201cLet us detain you and prepare a kid for you.\u201d

VThen Samson\u2019s wife harassed him with tears, and she said, \u201cYou really hate me, you don\u2019t love me. You asked my countrymen a riddle, and you didn\u2019t tell me the answer.\u201d He replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t even told my father and mother; shall I tell you?\u201d
p7159

VDuring the rest of the seven days of the feast she continued to harass him with her tears, and on the seventh day he told her, because she nagged him so. And she explained the riddle to her countrymen.

VOn the seventh day, before the sunset, the townsmen said to him:\u201cWhat is sweeter than honey,And what is stronger than a lion?\u201dHe responded:\u201cHad you not plowed with my heifer,You would not have guessed my riddle!\u201d

Vand he confided everything to her. He said to her, \u201cNo razor has ever touched my head, for I have been a nazirite to God since I was in my mother\u2019s womb. If my hair were cut, my strength would leave me and I should become as weak as an ordinary man.\u201d

VThere was a man in the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah.
p7218
sI2
VHe said to his mother, \u201cThe eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, so that you uttered an imprecation which you repeated in my hearing\u2014I have that silver; I took it.\u201d \u201cBlessed of the Lord be my son,\u201d said his mother.
p7219
sI3
VHe returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother; but his mother said, \u201cI herewith consecrate the silver to the Lord, transferring it to my son to make a sculptured image and a molten image. I now return it to you.\u201d
p7220
sI4
VSo when he gave the silver back to his mother, his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave it to a smith. He made of it a sculptured image and a molten image, which were kept in the house of Micah.
p7221
sI5
VNow the man Micah had a house of God; he had made an ephod and teraphim and he had inducted one of his sons to be his priest.

p7225

V\u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d Micah asked him. He replied, \u201cI am a Levite from Bethlehem of Judah, and I am traveling to take up residence wherever I can find a place.\u201d
p7226
sI10
V\u201cStay with me,\u201d Micah said to him, \u201cand be a father and a priest to me, and I will pay you ten shekels of silver a year, an allowance of clothing, and your food.\u201d The Levite went.
p7227
sI11
VThe Levite agreed to stay with the man, and the youth became like one of his own sons.
p7228

VMicah inducted the Levite, and the young man became his priest and remained in Micah\u2019s shrine.

VWhile in the vicinity of Micah\u2019s house, they recognized the speech of the young Levite, so they went over and asked him, \u201cWho brought you to these parts? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?\u201d
p7234
sI4
VHe replied, \u201cThus and thus Micah did for me\u2014he hired me and I became his priest.\u201d

They observed the people in it dwelling carefree, after the manner of the Sidonians, a tranquil and unsuspecting people, with no one in the land to molest them and with no hereditary ruler. Moreover, they were distant from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anybody.

VWhen [the men] came back to their kinsmen at Zorah and Eshtaol, their kinsmen asked them, \u201cHow did you fare?\u201d
p7239

VThey replied, \u201cLet us go at once and attack them! For we found that the land was very good, and you are sitting idle! Don\u2019t delay; go and invade the land and take possession of it,
p7240
sI10
Vfor God has delivered it into your hand. When you come, you will come to an unsuspecting people; and the land is spacious and nothing on earth is lacking there.\u201d

VThey departed from there, from the clan seat of the Danites, from Zorah and Eshtaol, six hundred strong, girt with weapons of war.

VThey went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. That is why that place is called \u201cthe Camp of Dan\u201d to this day; it lies west of Kiriath-jearim.

sI13
VFrom there they passed on to the hill country of Ephraim and arrived at the house of Micah.

VHere the five men who had gone to spy out the Laish region remarked to their kinsmen, \u201cDo you know, there is an ephod in these houses, and teraphim, and a sculptured image and a molten image? Now you know what you have to do.\u201d
p7245
sI15
VSo they turned off there and entered the home of the young Levite at Micah\u2019s house and greeted him.

sI16
VThe six hundred Danite men, girt with their weapons of war, stood at the entrance of the gate,
p7247
sI17
Vwhile the five men who had gone to spy out the land went inside and took the sculptured image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image. The priest was standing at the entrance of the gate, and the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war,
p7248
sI18
Vwhile those men entered Micah\u2019s house and took the sculptured image, the molten image, the ephod, and the household gods. The priest said to them, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d
p7249
sI19
VBut they said to him, \u201cBe quiet; put your hand on your mouth! Come with us and be our father and priest. Would you rather be priest to one man\u2019s household or be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?\u201d
p7250
sI20
VThe priest was delighted. He took the ephod, the household gods, and the sculptured image, and he joined the people.

sI21
VThey set out again, placing the children, the cattle, and their household goods in front.
p7252
sI22
VThey had already gone some distance from Micah\u2019s house, when the men in the houses near Micah\u2019s mustered and caught up with the Danites.
p7253
sI23
VThey called out to the Danites, who turned around and said to Micah, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Why have you mustered?\u201d
p7254
sI24
VHe said, \u201cYou have taken my priest and the gods that I made, and walked off! What do I have left? How can you ask, \u2018What\u2019s the matter\u2019?\u201d
p7255
sI25
VBut the Danites replied, \u201cDon\u2019t do any shouting at us, or some desperate men might attack you, and you and your family would lose your lives.\u201d
p7256
sI26
VSo Micah, realizing that they were stronger than he, turned back and went home; and the Danites went on their way,
p7257
sI27
Vtaking the things Micah had made and the priest he had acquired. They proceeded to Laish, a people tranquil and unsuspecting, and they put them to the sword and burned down the town.
p7258
sI28
VThere was none to come to the rescue, for it was distant from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone; it lay in the valley of Beth-rehob.They rebuilt the town and settled there,

VThen the man, his concubine, and his attendant started to leave. His father-in-law, the girl\u2019s father, said to him, \u201cLook, the day is waning toward evening; do stop for the night. See, the day is declining; spend the night here and enjoy yourself. You can start early tomorrow on your journey and head for home.\u201d
p7272
sI10
VBut the man refused to stay for the night. He set out and traveled as far as the vicinity of Jebus\u2014that is, Jerusalem; he had with him a pair of laden donkeys, and his concubine was with him.
p7273
sI11
VSince they were close to Jebus, and the day was very far spent, the attendant said to his master, \u201cLet us turn aside to this town of the Jebusites and spend the night in it.\u201d

VHe replied, \u201cWe are traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the other end of the hill country of Ephraim. That is where I live. I made a journey to Bethlehem of Judah, and now I am on my way to the House of the Lord, and nobody has taken me indoors.

VWhile they were enjoying themselves, the men of the town, a depraved lot, had gathered about the house and were pounding on the door. They called to the aged owner of the house, \u201cBring out the man who has come into your house, so that we can be intimate with him.\u201d
p7285

VThe Benjaminites thought, \u201cThey are being routed before us as previously.\u201d But the Israelites had planned: \u201cWe will take to flight and draw them away from the town to the roads.\u201d

VAnd while the main body of the Israelites had moved away from their positions and had drawn up in battle order at Baal-tamar, the Israelite ambush was rushing out from its position at Maareh-geba.

VThus 10,000 picked men of all Israel came to a point south of Gibeah, and the battle was furious. Before they realized that disaster was approaching,

sI38
VA time had been agreed upon by the Israelite men with those in ambush: When a huge column of smoke was sent up from the town,
p7332

sI40
VBut when the column, the pillar of smoke, began to rise from the city, the Benjaminites looked behind them, and there was the whole town going up in smoke to the sky!
p7334
sI41
VAnd now the Israelites turned about, and the men of Benjamin were thrown into panic, for they realized that disaster had overtaken them.
p7335
sI42
VThey retreated before the men of Israel along the road to the wilderness, where the fighting caught up with them; meanwhile those from the towns were massacring them in it.

VEarly the next day, the people built an altar there, and they brought burnt offerings and offerings of well-being.
p7347
sI5
VThe Israelites asked, \u201cIs there anyone from all the tribes of Israel who failed to come up to the assembly before the Lord?\u201d For a solemn oath had been taken concerning anyone who did not go up to the Lord at Mizpah: \u201cHe shall be put to death.\u201d
p7348
sI6
VThe Israelites now relented toward their kinsmen the Benjaminites, and they said, \u201cThis day one tribe has been cut off from Israel!
p7349
sI7
VWhat can we do to provide wives for those who are left, seeing that we have sworn by the Lord not to give any of our daughters to them in marriage?\u201d
p7350
sI8
VThey inquired, \u201cIs there anyone from the tribes of Israel who did not go up to the Lord at Mizpah?\u201d Now no one from Jabesh-gilead had come to the camp, to the assembly.
p7351
sI9
VFor, when the roll of the troops was taken, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was present.
p7352
sI10
VSo the assemblage dispatched 12,000 of the warriors, instructing them as follows: \u201cGo and put the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead to the sword, women and children included.
p7353
sI11
VThis is what you are to do: Proscribe every man, and every woman who has known a man carnally.\u201d
p7354
sI12
VThey found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 maidens who had not known a man carnally; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
p7355
sI13
VThen the whole community sent word to the Benjaminites who were at the Rock of Rimmon, and offered them terms of peace.
p7356
sI14
VThereupon the Benjaminites returned, and they gave them the girls who had been spared from the women of Jabesh-gilead. But there were not enough of them.
p7357
sI15
VNow the people had relented toward Benjamin, for the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
p7358
sI16
VSo the elders of the community asked, \u201cWhat can we do about wives for those who are left, since the women of Benjamin have been killed off?\u201d
p7359
sI17
VFor they said, \u201cThere must be a saving remnant for Benjamin, that a tribe may not be blotted out of Israel;
p7360
sI18
Vyet we cannot give them any of our daughters as wives,\u201d since the Israelites had taken an oath: \u201cCursed be anyone who gives a wife to Benjamin!\u201d
p7361
sI19
VThey said, \u201cThe annual feast of the Lord is now being held at Shiloh.\u201d (It lies north of Bethel, east of the highway that runs from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.)
p7362
sI20
VSo they instructed the Benjaminites as follows: \u201cGo and lie in wait in the vineyards.
p7363
sI21
VAs soon as you see the girls of Shiloh coming out to join in the dances, come out from the vineyards; let each of you seize a wife from among the girls of Shiloh, and be off for the land of Benjamin.
p7364
sI22
VAnd if their fathers or brothers come to us to complain, we shall say to them, \u2018Be generous to them for our sake! We could not provide any of them with a wife on account of the war, and you would have incurred guilt if you yourselves had given them [wives].\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p7365
sI23
VThe Benjaminites did so. They took to wife, from the dancers whom they carried off, as many as they themselves numbered. Then they went back to their own territory, and rebuilt their towns and settled in them.
p7366
sI24
VThereupon the Israelites dispersed, each to his own tribe and clan; everyone departed for his own territory.

VHe had two wives, one named Hannah and the other Peninnah; Peninnah had children, but Hannah was childless.
p7374

VThis man used to go up from his town every year to worship and to offer sacrifice to the Lord of Hosts at Shiloh.\u2014Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the Lord there.
p7375
sI4
VOne such day, Elkanah offered a sacrifice. He used to give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters;
p7376
sI5
Vbut to Hannah he would give one portion only\u2014though Hannah was his favorite\u2014for the Lord had closed her womb.
p7377
sI6
VMoreover, her rival, to make her miserable, would taunt her that the Lord had closed her womb.
p7378
sI7
VThis happened year after year: Every time she went up to the House of the Lord, the other would taunt her, so that she wept and would not eat.
p7379
sI8
VHer husband Elkanah said to her, \u201cHannah, why are you crying and why aren\u2019t you eating? Why are you so sad? Am I not more devoted to you than ten sons?\u201d

VAfter they had eaten and drunk at Shiloh, Hannah rose.\u2014The priest Eli was sitting on the seat near the doorpost of the temple of the Lord.\u2014
p7381
sI10
VIn her wretchedness, she prayed to the Lord, weeping all the while.
p7382
sI11
VAnd she made this vow: \u201cO Lord of Hosts, if You will look upon the suffering of Your maidservant and will remember me and not forget Your maidservant, and if You will grant Your maidservant a male child, I will dedicate him to the Lord for all the days of his life; and no razor shall ever touch his head.\u201d
p7383
sI12
VAs she kept on praying before the Lord, Eli watched her mouth.
p7384
sI13
VNow Hannah was praying in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard. So Eli thought she was drunk.
p7385
sI14
VEli said to her, \u201cHow long will you make a drunken spectacle of yourself? Sober up!\u201d
p7386
sI15
VAnd Hannah replied, \u201cOh no, my lord! I am a very unhappy woman. I have drunk no wine or other strong drink, but I have been pouring out my heart to the Lord.
p7387
sI16
VDo not take your maidservant for a worthless woman; I have only been speaking all this time out of my great anguish and distress.\u201d
p7388
sI17
V\u201cThen go in peace,\u201d said Eli, \u201cand may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of Him.\u201d
p7389

VShe answered, \u201cYou are most kind to your handmaid.\u201d So the woman left, and she ate, and was no longer downcast.

sI20
VHannah conceived, and at the turn of the year bore a son. She named him Samuel, meaning, \u201cI asked the Lord for him.\u201d
p7392
sI21
VAnd when the man Elkanah and all his household were going up to offer to the Lord the annual sacrifice and his votive sacrifice,
p7393
sI22
VHannah did not go up. She said to her husband, \u201cWhen the child is weaned, I will bring him. For when he has appeared before the Lord, he must remain there for good.\u201d
p7394
sI23
VHer husband Elkanah said to her, \u201cDo as you think best. Stay home until you have weaned him. May the Lord fulfill His word.\u201d So the woman stayed home and nursed her son until she weaned him.
p7395
sI24
VWhen she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a jar of wine. And though the boy was still very young, she brought him to the House of the Lord at Shiloh.

p7414
sI14
Vand he would thrust it into the cauldron, or the kettle, or the great pot, or the small cooking-pot; and whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take away on it. This was the practice at Shiloh with all the Israelites who came there.
p7415
sI15
V[But now] even before the suet was turned into smoke, the priest\u2019s boy would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, \u201cHand over some meat to roast for the priest; for he won\u2019t accept boiled meat from you, only raw.\u201d
p7416
sI16
VAnd if the man said to him, \u201cLet them first turn the suet into smoke, and then take as much as you want,\u201d he would reply, \u201cNo, hand it over at once or I\u2019ll take it by force.\u201d

VFor the Lord took note of Hannah; she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. Young Samuel meanwhile grew up in the service of the Lord.

sI22
VNow Eli was very old. When he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who performed tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting,
p7423
sI23
Vhe said to them, \u201cWhy do you do such things? I get evil reports about you from the people on all hands.

VThey answered, \u201cIf you are going to send the Ark of the God of Israel away, do not send it away without anything; you must also pay an indemnity to Him. Then you will be healed, and He will make Himself known to you; otherwise His hand will not turn away from you.\u201d
p7499
sI4
VThey asked, \u201cWhat is the indemnity that we should pay to Him?\u201d They answered, \u201cFive golden hemorrhoids and five golden mice, corresponding to the number of lords of the Philistines; for the same plague struck all of you and your lords.
p7500

VThen watch: If it goes up the road to Beth-shemesh, to His own territory, it was He who has inflicted this great harm on us. But if not, we shall know that it was not His hand that struck us; it just happened to us by chance.\u201d

VThey placed the Ark of the Lord on the cart together with the chest, the golden mice, and the figures of their hemorrhoids.
p7507
sI12
VThe cows went straight ahead along the road to Beth-shemesh. They went along a single highroad, lowing as they went, and turning off neither to the right nor to the left; and the lords of the Philistines walked behind them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.

sI13
VThe people of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. They looked up and saw the Ark, and they rejoiced when they saw [it].
p7509
sI14
VThe cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and it stopped there. They split up the wood of the cart and presented the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord. A large stone was there;

p7513
sI18
VAs for the golden mice, their number accorded with all the Philistine towns that belonged to the five lords\u2014both fortified towns and unwalled villages, as far as the great stone on which the Ark of the Lord was set down, to this day, in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.

V[The Lord] struck at the men of Beth-shemesh because they looked into the Ark of the Lord; He struck down seventy men among the people [and] fifty thousand men. The people mourned, for He had inflicted a great slaughter upon the population.

VAnd Samuel said to all the House of Israel, \u201cIf you mean to return to the Lord with all your heart, you must remove the alien gods and the Ashtaroth from your midst and direct your heart to the Lord and serve Him alone. Then He will deliver you from the hands of the Philistines.\u201d

VThey assembled at Mizpah, and they drew water and poured it out before the Lord; they fasted that day, and there they confessed that they had sinned against the Lord. And Samuel acted as chieftain of the Israelites at Mizpah.
p7524
sI7
VWhen the Philistines heard that the Israelites had assembled at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines marched out against Israel. Hearing of this, the Israelites were terrified of the Philistines

Vand they implored Samuel, \u201cDo not neglect us and do not refrain from crying out to the Lord our God to save us from the hands of the Philistines.\u201d

sI9
VThereupon Samuel took a suckling lamb and sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord; and Samuel cried out to the Lord in behalf of Israel, and the Lord responded to him.
p7527

VSamuel was displeased that they said \u201cGive us a king to govern us.\u201d Samuel prayed to the Lord,
p7542

Vand the Lord replied to Samuel, \u201cHeed the demand of the people in everything they say to you. For it is not you that they have rejected; it is Me they have rejected as their king.

VLike everything else they have done ever since I brought them out of Egypt to this day\u2014forsaking Me and worshiping other gods\u2014so they are doing to you.

VHeed their demand; but warn them solemnly, and tell them about the practices of any king who will rule over them.\u201d
p7545
sI10
VSamuel reported all the words of the Lord to the people, who were asking him for a king.
p7546
sI11
VHe said, \u201cThis will be the practice of the king who will rule over you: He will take your sons and appoint them as his charioteers and horsemen, and they will serve as outrunners for his chariots.
p7547
sI12
VHe will appoint them as his chiefs of thousands and of fifties; or they will have to plow his fields, reap his harvest, and make his weapons and the equipment for his chariots.
p7548

p7560

VHe had a son whose name was Saul, an excellent young man; no one among the Israelites was handsomer than he; he was a head taller than any of the people.
p7561
sI3
VOnce the asses of Saul\u2019s father Kish went astray, and Kish said to his son Saul, \u201cTake along one of the servants and go out and look for the asses.\u201d
p7562
sI4
VHe passed into the hill country of Ephraim. He crossed the district of Shalishah, but they did not find them. They passed through the district of Shaalim, but they were not there. They traversed the [entire] territory of Benjamin, and still they did not find them.
p7563
sI5
VWhen they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, \u201cLet us turn back, or my father will stop worrying about the asses and begin to worry about us.\u201d
p7564
sI6
VBut he replied, \u201cThere is a man of God in that town, and the man is highly esteemed; everything that he says comes true. Let us go there; perhaps he will tell us about the errand on which we set out.\u201d
p7565
sI7
V\u201cBut if we go,\u201d Saul said to his servant, \u201cwhat can we bring the man? For the food in our bags is all gone, and there is nothing we can bring to the man of God as a present. What have we got?\u201d
p7566
sI8
VThe servant answered Saul again, \u201cI happen to have a quarter-shekel of silver. I can give that to the man of God and he will tell us about our errand.\u201d\u2014
p7567
sI9
VFormerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say, \u201cCome, let us go to the seer,\u201d for the prophet of today was formerly called a seer.\u2014
p7568
sI10
VSaul said to his servant, \u201cA good idea; let us go.\u201d And they went to the town where the man of God lived.
p7569
sI11
VAs they were climbing the ascent to the town, they met some girls coming out to draw water, and they asked them, \u201cIs the seer in town?\u201d
p7570
sI12
V\u201cYes,\u201d they replied. \u201cHe is up there ahead of you. Hurry, for he has just come to the town because the people have a sacrifice at the shrine today.
p7571
sI13
VAs soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the shrine to eat; the people will not eat until he comes; for he must first bless the sacrifice and only then will the guests eat. Go up at once, for you will find him right away.\u201d
p7572
sI14
VSo they went up to the town; and as they were entering the town, Samuel came out toward them, on his way up to the shrine.
p7573
sI15
VNow the day before Saul came, the Lord had revealed the following to Samuel:
p7574
sI16
V\u201cAt this time tomorrow, I will send a man to you from the territory of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him ruler of My people Israel. He will deliver My people from the hands of the Philistines; for I have taken note of My people, their outcry has come to Me.\u201d
p7575
sI17
VAs soon as Samuel saw Saul, the Lord declared to him, \u201cThis is the man that I told you would govern My people.\u201d
p7576
sI18
VSaul approached Samuel inside the gate and said to him, \u201cTell me, please, where is the house of the seer?\u201d
p7577
sI19
VAnd Samuel answered Saul, \u201cI am the seer. Go up ahead of me to the shrine, for you shall eat with me today; and in the morning I will let you go, after telling you whatever may be on your mind.
p7578
sI20
VAs for your asses that strayed three days ago, do not concern yourself about them, for they have been found. And for whom is all Israel yearning, if not for you and all your ancestral house?\u201d
p7579
sI21
VSaul replied, \u201cBut I am only a Benjaminite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my clan is the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin! Why do you say such things to me?\u201d
p7580
sI22
VSamuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and gave them a place at the head of the guests, who numbered about thirty.
p7581
sI23
VAnd Samuel said to the cook, \u201cBring the portion which I gave you and told you to set aside.\u201d
p7582
sI24
VThe cook lifted up the thigh and what was on it, and set it before Saul. And [Samuel] said, \u201cWhat has been reserved is set before you. Eat; it has been kept for you for this occasion, when I said I was inviting the people.\u201d So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
p7583
sI25
VThey then descended from the shrine to the town, and [Samuel] talked with Saul on the roof.
p7584
sI26
VEarly, at the break of day, Samuel called to Saul on the roof. He said, \u201cGet up, and I will send you off.\u201d Saul arose, and the two of them, Samuel and he, went outside.
p7585
sI27
VAs they were walking toward the end of the town, Samuel said to Saul, \u201cTell the servant to walk ahead of us\u201d\u2014and he walked ahead\u2014\u201cbut you stop here a moment and I will make known to you the word of God.\u201d

p7588
sI2
VWhen you leave me today, you will meet two men near the tomb of Rachel in the territory of Benjamin, at Zelzah, and they will tell you that the asses you set out to look for have been found, and that your father has stopped being concerned about the asses and is worrying about you, saying: \u2018What shall I do about my son?\u2019
p7589
sI3
VYou shall pass on from there until you come to the terebinth of Tabor. There you will be met by three men making a pilgrimage to God at Bethel. One will be carrying three kids, another will be carrying three loaves of bread, and the third will be carrying a jar of wine.
p7590
sI4
VThey will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept.
p7591
sI5
VAfter that, you are to go on to the Hill of God, where the Philistine prefects reside. There, as you enter the town, you will encounter a band of prophets coming down from the shrine, preceded by lyres, timbrels, flutes, and harps, and they will be speaking in ecstasy.
p7592
sI6
VThe spirit of the Lord will grip you, and you will speak in ecstasy along with them; you will become another man.
p7593
sI7
VAnd once these signs have happened to you, act when the occasion arises, for God is with you.
p7594
sI8
VAfter that, you are to go down to Gilgal ahead of me, and I will come down to you to present burnt offerings and offer sacrifices of well-being. Wait seven days until I come to you and instruct you what you are to do next.\u201d
p7595
sI9
VAs [Saul] turned around to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all those signs were fulfilled that same day.
p7596
sI10
VAnd when they came there, to the Hill, he saw a band of prophets coming toward him. Thereupon the spirit of God gripped him, and he spoke in ecstasy among them.
p7597
sI11
VWhen all who knew him previously saw him speaking in ecstasy together with the prophets, the people said to one another, \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul too among the prophets?\u201d
p7598
sI12
VBut another person there spoke up and said, \u201cAnd who are their fathers?\u201d Thus the proverb arose: \u201cIs Saul too among the prophets?\u201d
p7599
sI13
VAnd when he stopped speaking in ecstasy, he entered the shrine.
p7600
sI14
VSaul\u2019s uncle asked him and his servant, \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d \u201cTo look for the asses,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd when we saw that they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.\u201d
p7601
sI15
V\u201cTell me,\u201d said Saul\u2019s uncle, \u201cwhat did Samuel say to you?\u201d
p7602

VSamuel summoned the people to the Lord at Mizpah

Vand said to them, \u201cThus said the Lord, the God of Israel: \u2018I brought Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hands of the Egyptians and of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.\u2019
p7605
sI19
VBut today you have rejected your God who delivered you from all your troubles and calamities. For you said, \u2018No, set up a king over us!\u2019 Now station yourselves before the Lord, by your tribes and clans.\u201d
p7606
sI20
VSamuel brought forward each of the tribes of Israel, and the lot indicated the tribe of Benjamin.
p7607
sI21
VThen Samuel brought forward the tribe of Benjamin by its clans, and the clan of the Matrites was indicated; and then Saul son of Kish was indicated. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found.
p7608
sI22
VThey inquired of the Lord again, \u201cHas anyone else come here?\u201d And the Lord replied, \u201cYes; he is hiding among the baggage.\u201d
p7609

VSo they ran over and brought him from there; and when he took his place among the people, he stood a head taller than all the people.

VSamuel expounded to the people the rules of the monarchy, and recorded them in a document which he deposited before the Lord. Samuel then sent the people back to their homes.

VSaul also went home to Gibeah, accompanied by upstanding men whose hearts God had touched.

VSamuel prayed to the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day, and the people stood in awe of the Lord and of Samuel.
p7649
sI19
VThe people all said to Samuel, \u201cIntercede for your servants with the Lord your God that we may not die, for we have added to all our sins the wickedness of asking for a king.\u201d
p7650

VBut Samuel said to the people, \u201cHave no fear. You have, indeed, done all those wicked things. Do not, however, turn away from the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart.

VSaul picked 3,000 Israelites, of whom 2,000 were with Saul in Michmas and in the hill country of Bethel, and 1,000 with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin; the rest of the troops he sent back to their homes.
p7659
sI3
VJonathan struck down the Philistine prefect in Geba; and the Philistines heard about it. Saul had the ram\u2019s horn sounded throughout the land, saying, \u201cLet the Hebrews hear.\u201d
p7660
sI4
VWhen all Israel heard that Saul had struck down the Philistine prefect, and that Israel had incurred the wrath of the Philistines, all the people rallied to Saul at Gilgal.
p7661
sI5
VThe Philistines, in turn, gathered to attack Israel: 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and troops as numerous as the sands of the seashore. They marched up and encamped at Michmas, east of Beth-aven.

VSome Hebrews crossed the Jordan, [to] the territory of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal, and the rest of the people rallied to him in alarm.

VSaul said, \u201cBring me the burnt offering and the sacrifice of well-being\u201d; and he presented the burnt offering.
p7666
sI10
VHe had just finished presenting the burnt offering when Samuel arrived; and Saul went out to meet him and welcome him.
p7667
sI11
VBut Samuel said, \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Saul replied, \u201cI saw the people leaving me and scattering; you had not come at the appointed time, and the Philistines had gathered at Michmas.
p7668
sI12
VI thought the Philistines would march down against me at Gilgal before I had entreated the Lord, so I forced myself to present the burnt offering.\u201d
p7669
sI13
VSamuel answered Saul, \u201cYou acted foolishly in not keeping the commandments that the Lord your God laid upon you! Otherwise the Lord would have established your dynasty over Israel forever.

VNo smith was to be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines were afraid that the Hebrews would make swords or spears.
p7676
sI20
VSo all the Israelites had to go down to the Philistines to have their plowshares, their mattocks, axes, and colters sharpened.
p7677
sI21
VThe charge for sharpening was a pim for plowshares, mattocks, three-pronged forks, and axes, and for setting the goads.

VThe men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his arms-bearer, \u201cCome up to us, and we\u2019ll teach you a lesson.\u201d Then Jonathan said to his arms-bearer, \u201cFollow me, for the Lord will deliver them into the hands of Israel.\u201d

VSaul\u2019s scouts in Gibeah of Benjamin saw that the multitude was scattering in all directions.
p7697

VSaul and the troops with him assembled and rushed into battle; they found [the Philistines] in very great confusion, every man\u2019s sword turned against his fellow.
p7701

VAnd the Hebrews who had previously sided with the Philistines, who had come up with them in the army [from] round about\u2014they too joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
p7702
sI22
VWhen all the men of Israel who were hiding in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too pursued them in battle.
p7703
sI23
VThus the Lord brought victory to Israel that day.The fighting passed beyond Beth-aven.
p7704
sI24
VThe men of Israel were distressed that day. For Saul had laid an oath upon the troops: \u201cCursed be the man who eats any food before night falls and I take revenge on my enemies.\u201d So none of the troops ate anything.
p7705
sI25
VEverybody came to a stack of beehives where some honey had spilled on the ground.
p7706
sI26
VWhen the troops came to the beehives and found the flow of honey there, no one put his hand to his mouth, for the troops feared the oath.
p7707
sI27
VJonathan, however, had not heard his father adjure the troops. So he put out the stick he had with him, dipped it into the beehive of honey, and brought his hand back to his mouth; and his eyes lit up.
p7708
sI28
VAt this one of the soldiers spoke up, \u201cYour father adjured the troops: \u2018Cursed be the man who eats anything this day.\u2019 And so the troops are faint.\u201d
p7709
sI29
VJonathan answered, \u201cMy father has brought trouble on the people. See for yourselves how my eyes lit up when I tasted that bit of honey.
p7710
sI30
VIf only the troops had eaten today of spoil captured from the enemy, the defeat of the Philistines would have been greater still!\u201d
p7711
sI31
VThey struck down the Philistines that day from Michmas to Aijalon, and the troops were famished.
p7712
sI32
VThe troops pounced on the spoil; they took the sheep and cows and calves and slaughtered them on the ground, and the troops ate with the blood.
p7713
sI33
VWhen it was reported to Saul that the troops were sinning against the Lord, eating with the blood, he said, \u201cYou have acted faithlessly. Roll a large stone over to me today.\u201d
p7714
sI34
VAnd Saul ordered, \u201cSpread out among the troops and tell them that everyone must bring me his ox or his sheep and slaughter it here, and then eat. You must not sin against the Lord and eat with the blood.\u201d Every one of the troops brought his own ox with him that night and slaughtered it there.
p7715
sI35
VThus Saul set up an altar to the Lord; it was the first altar he erected to the Lord.
p7716
sI36
VSaul said, \u201cLet us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder among them until the light of morning; and let us not leave a single survivor among them.\u201d \u201cDo whatever you please,\u201d they replied. But the priest said, \u201cLet us approach God here.\u201d
p7717
sI37
VSo Saul inquired of God, \u201cShall I go down after the Philistines? Will You deliver them into the hands of Israel?\u201d But this time He did not respond to him.
p7718
sI38
VThen Saul said, \u201cCome forward, all chief officers of the troops, and find out how this guilt was incurred today.
p7719
sI39
VFor as the Lord lives who brings victory to Israel, even if it was through my son Jonathan, he shall be put to death!\u201d Not one soldier answered him.
p7720

VAnd he said to all the Israelites, \u201cYou stand on one side, and my son Jonathan and I shall stand on the other.\u201d The troops said to Saul, \u201cDo as you please.\u201d
p7721
sI41
VSaul then said to the Lord, the God of Israel, \u201cShow Thammim.\u201d Jonathan and Saul were indicated by lot, and the troops were cleared.
p7722
sI42
VAnd Saul said, \u201cCast the lots between my son and me\u201d; and Jonathan was indicated.
p7723
sI43
VSaul said to Jonathan, \u201cTell me, what have you done?\u201d And Jonathan told him, \u201cI only tasted a bit of honey with the tip of the stick in my hand. I am ready to die.\u201d
p7724
sI44
VSaul said, \u201cThus and more may God do: You shall be put to death, Jonathan!\u201d
p7725
sI45
VBut the troops said to Saul, \u201cShall Jonathan die, after bringing this great victory to Israel? Never! As the Lord lives, not a hair of his head shall fall to the ground! For he brought this day to pass with the help of God.\u201d Thus the troops saved Jonathan and he did not die.

VSaul broke off his pursuit of the Philistines, and the Philistines returned to their homes.
p7727
sI47
VAfter Saul had secured his kingship over Israel, he waged war on every side against all his enemies: against the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, the Philistines, and the kings of Zobah; and wherever he turned he worsted [them].
p7728
sI48
VHe was triumphant, defeating the Amalekites and saving Israel from those who plundered it.

VSaul mustered the troops and enrolled them at Telaim: 200,000 men on foot, and 10,000 men of Judah.

VSaul said to the Kenites, \u201cCome, withdraw at once from among the Amalekites, that I may not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they left Egypt.\u201d So the Kenites withdrew from among the Amalekites.

VSaul destroyed Amalek from Havilah all the way to Shur, which is close to Egypt,

p7742

p7743
sI10
VThe word of the Lord then came to Samuel:
p7744
sI11
V\u201cI regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned away from Me and has not carried out My commands.\u201d Samuel was distressed and he entreated the Lord all night long.
p7745

VEarly in the morning Samuel went to meet Saul. Samuel was told, \u201cSaul went to Carmel, where he erected a monument for himself; then he left and went on down to Gilgal.\u201d

V\u201cThen what,\u201d demanded Samuel, \u201cis this bleating of sheep in my ears, and the lowing of oxen that I hear?\u201d
p7748
sI15
VSaul answered, \u201cThey were brought from the Amalekites, for the troops spared the choicest of the sheep and oxen for sacrificing to the Lord your God. And we proscribed the rest.\u201d
p7749
sI16
VSamuel said to Saul, \u201cStop! Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night!\u201d \u201cSpeak,\u201d he replied.

VAnd Samuel said, \u201cYou may look small to yourself, but you are the head of the tribes of Israel. The Lord anointed you king over Israel,

Vand the Lord sent you on a mission, saying, \u2018Go and proscribe the sinful Amalekites; make war on them until you have exterminated them.\u2019

VWhy did you disobey the Lord and swoop down on the spoil in defiance of the Lord\u2019s will?\u201d
p7753
sI20
VSaul said to Samuel, \u201cBut I did obey the Lord! I performed the mission on which the Lord sent me: I captured King Agag of Amalek, and I proscribed Amalek,

Vand the troops took from the spoil some sheep and oxen\u2014the best of what had been proscribed\u2014to sacrifice to the Lord your God at Gilgal.\u201d

VFor rebellion is like the sin of divination,Defiance, like the iniquity of teraphim.Because you rejected the Lord\u2019s command,He has rejected you as king.\u201d
p7757
sI24
VSaul said to Samuel, \u201cI did wrong to transgress the Lord\u2019s command and your instructions; but I was afraid of the troops and I yielded to them.
p7758
sI25
VPlease, forgive my offense and come back with me, and I will bow low to the Lord.\u201d
p7759

VMoreover, the Glory of Israel does not deceive or change His mind, for He is not human that He should change His mind.\u201d

VSamuel replied, \u201cHow can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.\u201d The Lord answered, \u201cTake a heifer with you, and say, \u2018I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.\u2019

VInvite Jesse to the sacrificial feast, and then I will make known to you what you shall do; you shall anoint for Me the one I point out to you.\u201d
p7773
sI4
VSamuel did what the Lord commanded. When he came to Bethlehem, the elders of the city went out in alarm to meet him and said, \u201cDo you come on a peaceful errand?\u201d
p7774
sI5
V\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, \u201cI have come to sacrifice to the Lord. Purify yourselves and join me in the sacrificial feast.\u201d He also instructed Jesse and his sons to purify themselves and invited them to the sacrificial feast.

sI6
VWhen they arrived and he saw Eliab, he thought: \u201cSurely the Lord\u2019s anointed stands before Him.\u201d
p7776
sI7
VBut the Lord said to Samuel, \u201cPay no attention to his appearance or his stature, for I have rejected him. For not as man sees [does the Lord see]; man sees only what is visible, but the Lord sees into the heart.\u201d
p7777
sI8
VThen Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass before Samuel; but he said, \u201cThe Lord has not chosen this one either.\u201d
p7778
sI9
VNext Jesse presented Shammah; and again he said, \u201cThe Lord has not chosen this one either.\u201d
p7779
sI10
VThus Jesse presented seven of his sons before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, \u201cThe Lord has not chosen any of these.\u201d
p7780
sI11
VThen Samuel asked Jesse, \u201cAre these all the boys you have?\u201d He replied, \u201cThere is still the youngest; he is tending the flock.\u201d And Samuel said to Jesse, \u201cSend someone to bring him, for we will not sit down to eat until he gets here.\u201d
p7781

VSo they sent and brought him. He was ruddy-cheeked, bright-eyed, and handsome. And the Lord said, \u201cRise and anoint him, for this is the one.\u201d

sI13
VSamuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the Lord gripped David from that day on. Samuel then set out for Ramah.

VNow the spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord began to terrify him.
p7784

VSaul\u2019s courtiers said to him, \u201cAn evil spirit of God is terrifying you.
p7785

VLet our lord give the order [and] the courtiers in attendance on you will look for someone who is skilled at playing the lyre; whenever the evil spirit of God comes over you, he will play it and you will feel better.\u201d
p7786
sI17
VSo Saul said to his courtiers, \u201cFind me someone who can play well and bring him to me.\u201d
p7787
sI18
VOne of the attendants spoke up, \u201cI have observed a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilled in music; he is a stalwart fellow and a warrior, sensible in speech, and handsome in appearance, and the Lord is with him.\u201d
p7788
sI19
VWhereupon Saul sent messengers to Jesse to say, \u201cSend me your son David, who is with the flock.\u201d
p7789
sI20
VJesse took an ass [laden with] bread, a skin of wine, and a kid, and sent them to Saul by his son David.

VSaul and the men of Israel massed and encamped in the valley of Elah. They drew up their line of battle against the Philistines,
p7796

Vwith the Philistines stationed on one hill and Israel stationed on the opposite hill; the ravine was between them.
p7797

VA champion of the Philistine forces stepped forward; his name was Goliath of Gath, and he was six cubits and a span tall.
p7798
sI5
VHe had a bronze helmet on his head, and wore a breastplate of scale armor, a bronze breastplate weighing five thousand shekels.
p7799
sI6
VHe had bronze greaves on his legs, and a bronze javelin [slung] from his shoulders.
p7800
sI7
VThe shaft of his spear was like a weaver\u2019s bar, and the iron head of his spear weighed six hundred shekels; and the shield-bearer marched in front of him.
p7801
sI8
VHe stopped and called out to the ranks of Israel and he said to them, \u201cWhy should you come out to engage in battle? I am the Philistine [champion], and you are Saul\u2019s servants. Choose one of your men and let him come down against me.

VIf he bests me in combat and kills me, we will become your slaves; but if I best him and kill him, you shall be our slaves and serve us.\u201d

VAnd the Philistine ended, \u201cI herewith defy the ranks of Israel. Get me a man and let\u2019s fight it out!\u201d

VWhen Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and terror-stricken.

VDavid was the son of a certain Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah whose name was Jesse. He had eight sons, and in the days of Saul the man was already old, advanced in years.
p7806
sI13
VThe three oldest sons of Jesse had left and gone with Saul to the war. The names of his three sons who had gone to the war were Eliab the first-born, the next Abinadab, and the third Shammah;
p7807
sI14
Vand David was the youngest. The three oldest had followed Saul,
p7808
sI15
Vand David would go back and forth from attending on Saul to shepherd his father\u2019s flock at Bethlehem.
p7809
sI16
VThe Philistine stepped forward morning and evening and took his stand for forty days.
p7810

VJesse said to his son David, \u201cTake an ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers, and carry them quickly to your brothers in camp.

VTake these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand. Find out how your brothers are and bring some token from them.\u201d

VSaul and the brothers and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, in the war against the Philistines.
p7813

sI21
VIsrael and the Philistines drew up their battle lines opposite each other.
p7815
sI22
VDavid left his baggage with the man in charge of the baggage and ran toward the battle line and went to greet his brothers.
p7816
sI23
VWhile he was talking to them, the champion, whose name was Goliath, the Philistine of Gath, stepped forward from the Philistine ranks and spoke the same words as before; and David heard him.
p7817
sI24
VWhen the men of Israel saw the man, they fled in terror.
p7818
sI25
VAnd the men of Israel were saying [among themselves], \u201cDo you see that man coming out? He comes out to defy Israel! The man who kills him will be rewarded by the king with great riches; he will also give him his daughter in marriage and grant exemption to his father\u2019s house in Israel.\u201d
p7819
sI26
VDavid asked the men standing near him, \u201cWhat will be done for the man who kills that Philistine and removes the disgrace from Israel? Who is that uncircumcised Philistine that he dares defy the ranks of the living God?\u201d
p7820
sI27
VThe troops told him in the same words what would be done for the man who killed him.
p7821
sI28
VWhen Eliab, his oldest brother, heard him speaking to the men, Eliab became angry with David and said, \u201cWhy did you come down here, and with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your impudence and your impertinence: you came down to watch the fighting!\u201d
p7822
sI29
VBut David replied, \u201cWhat have I done now? I was only asking!\u201d
p7823
sI30
VAnd he turned away from him toward someone else; he asked the same question, and the troops gave him the same answer as before.
p7824
sI31
VThe things David said were overheard and were reported to Saul, who had him brought over.
p7825
sI32
VDavid said to Saul, \u201cLet no man\u2019s courage fail him. Your servant will go and fight that Philistine!\u201d
p7826
sI33
VBut Saul said to David, \u201cYou cannot go to that Philistine and fight him; you are only a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth!\u201d
p7827
sI34
VDavid replied to Saul, \u201cYour servant has been tending his father\u2019s sheep, and if a lion or a bear came and carried off an animal from the flock,
p7828
sI35
VI would go after it and fight it and rescue it from its mouth. And if it attacked me, I would seize it by the beard and strike it down and kill it.
p7829
sI36
VYour servant has killed both lion and bear; and that uncircumcised Philistine shall end up like one of them, for he has defied the ranks of the living God.
p7830
sI37
VThe Lord,\u201d David went on, \u201cwho saved me from lion and bear will also save me from that Philistine.\u201d \u201cThen go,\u201d Saul said to David, \u201cand may the Lord be with you!\u201d
p7831
sI38
VSaul clothed David in his own garment; he placed a bronze helmet on his head and fastened a breastplate on him.
p7832
sI39
VDavid girded his sword over his garment. Then he tried to walk; but he was not used to it. And David said to Saul, \u201cI cannot walk in these, for I am not used to them.\u201d So David took them off.
p7833
sI40
VHe took his stick, picked a few smooth stones from the wadi, put them in the pocket of his shepherd\u2019s bag and, sling in hand, he went toward the Philistine.
p7834
sI41
VThe Philistine, meanwhile, was coming closer to David, preceded by his shield-bearer.
p7835
sI42
VWhen the Philistine caught sight of David, he scorned him, for he was but a boy, ruddy and handsome.
p7836
sI43
VAnd the Philistine called out to David, \u201cAm I a dog that you come against me with sticks?\u201d The Philistine cursed David by his gods;
p7837
sI44
Vand the Philistine said to David, \u201cCome here, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field.\u201d
p7838
sI45
VDavid replied to the Philistine, \u201cYou come against me with sword and spear and javelin; but I come against you in the name of the Lord of Hosts, the God of the ranks of Israel, whom you have defied.
p7839
sI46
VThis very day the Lord will deliver you into my hands. I will kill you and cut off your head; and I will give the carcasses of the Philistine camp to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth. All the earth shall know that there is a God in Israel.
p7840
sI47
VAnd this whole assembly shall know that the Lord can give victory without sword or spear. For the battle is the Lord\u2019s, and He will deliver you into our hands.\u201d
p7841
sI48
VWhen the Philistine began to advance toward him again, David quickly ran up to the battle line to face the Philistine.
p7842
sI49
VDavid put his hand into the bag; he took out a stone and slung it. It struck the Philistine in the forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell face down on the ground.
p7843
sI50
VThus David bested the Philistine with sling and stone; he struck him down and killed him. David had no sword;
p7844
sI51
Vso David ran up and stood over the Philistine, grasped his sword and pulled it from its sheath; and with it he dispatched him and cut off his head.When the Philistines saw that their warrior was dead, they ran.
p7845
sI52
VThe men of Israel and Judah rose up with a war cry and they pursued the Philistines all the way to Gai and up to the gates of Ekron; the Philistines fell mortally wounded along the road to Shaarim up to Gath and Ekron.
p7846
sI53
VThen the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines and looted their camp.
p7847
sI54
VDavid took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; and he put his weapons in his own tent.
p7848
sI55
VWhen Saul saw David going out to assault the Philistine, he asked his army commander Abner, \u201cWhose son is that boy, Abner?\u201d And Abner replied, \u201cBy your life, Your Majesty, I do not know.\u201d
p7849
sI56
V\u201cThen find out whose son that young fellow is,\u201d the king ordered.
p7850
sI57
VSo when David returned after killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him to Saul, with the head of the Philistine still in his hand.
p7851
sI58
VSaul said to him, \u201cWhose son are you, my boy?\u201d And David answered, \u201cThe son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.\u201d

VWhen [David] finished speaking with Saul, Jonathan\u2019s soul became bound up with the soul of David; Jonathan loved David as himself.
p7854
sI2
VSaul took him [into his service] that day and would not let him return to his father\u2019s house.\u2014
p7855
sI3
VJonathan and David made a pact, because [Jonathan] loved him as himself.
p7856
sI4
VJonathan took off the cloak and tunic he was wearing and gave them to David, together with his sword, bow, and belt.
p7857
sI5
VDavid went out [with the troops], and he was successful in every mission on which Saul sent him, and Saul put him in command of all the soldiers; this pleased all the troops and Saul\u2019s courtiers as well.
p7858
sI6
VWhen the [troops] came home [and] David returned from killing the Philistine, the women of all the towns of Israel came out singing and dancing to greet King Saul with timbrels, shouting, and sistrums.
p7859
sI7
VThe women sang as they danced, and they chanted:Saul has slain his thousands;David, his tens of thousands!
p7860
sI8
VSaul was much distressed and greatly vexed about the matter. For he said, \u201cTo David they have given tens of thousands, and to me they have given thousands. All that he lacks is the kingship!\u201d
p7861
sI9
VFrom that day on Saul kept a jealous eye on David.
p7862
sI10
VThe next day an evil spirit of God gripped Saul and he began to rave in the house, while David was playing [the lyre], as he did daily. Saul had a spear in his hand,
p7863
sI11
Vand Saul threw the spear, thinking to pin David to the wall. But David eluded him twice.
p7864
sI12
VSaul was afraid of David, for the Lord was with him and had turned away from Saul.
p7865
sI13
VSo Saul removed him from his presence and appointed him chief of a thousand, to march at the head of the troops.
p7866
sI14
VDavid was successful in all his undertakings, for the Lord was with him;
p7867
sI15
Vand when Saul saw that he was successful, he dreaded him.
p7868
sI16
VAll Israel and Judah loved David, for he marched at their head.
p7869

VSaul said to David, \u201cHere is my older daughter, Merab; I will give her to you in marriage; in return, you be my warrior and fight the battles of the Lord.\u201d Saul thought: \u201cLet not my hand strike him; let the hand of the Philistines strike him.\u201d
p7870
sI18
VDavid replied to Saul, \u201cWho am I and what is my life\u2014my father\u2019s family in Israel\u2014that I should become Your Majesty\u2019s son-in-law?\u201d
p7871
sI19
VBut at the time that Merab, daughter of Saul, should have been given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel the Meholathite.
p7872
sI20
VNow Michal daughter of Saul had fallen in love with David; and when this was reported to Saul, he was pleased.
p7873
sI21
VSaul thought: \u201cI will give her to him, and she can serve as a snare for him, so that the Philistines may kill him.\u201d So Saul said to David, \u201cYou can become my son-in-law even now through the second one.\u201d
p7874
sI22
VAnd Saul instructed his courtiers to say to David privately, \u201cThe king is fond of you and all his courtiers like you. So why not become the king\u2019s son-in-law?\u201d
p7875
sI23
VWhen the king\u2019s courtiers repeated these words to David, David replied, \u201cDo you think that becoming the son-in-law of a king is a small matter, when I am but a poor man of no consequence?\u201d
p7876
sI24
VSaul\u2019s courtiers reported to him, \u201cThis is what David answered.\u201d
p7877
sI25
VAnd Saul said, \u201cSay this to David: \u2018The king desires no other bride-price than the foreskins of a hundred Philistines, as vengeance on the king\u2019s enemies.\u2019\ufeff\u201d\u2014Saul intended to bring about David\u2019s death at the hands of the Philistines.\u2014
p7878
sI26
VWhen his courtiers told this to David, David was pleased with the idea of becoming the king\u2019s son-in-law. Before the time had expired,
p7879
sI27
VDavid went out with his men and killed two hundred Philistines; David brought their foreskins and they were counted out for the king, that he might become the king\u2019s son-in-law. Saul then gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.
p7880
sI28
VWhen Saul realized that the Lord was with David and that Michal daughter of Saul loved him,

sI29
VSaul grew still more afraid of David; and Saul was David\u2019s enemy ever after.

p7888

VHe took his life in his hands and killed the Philistine, and the Lord wrought a great victory for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then should you incur the guilt of shedding the blood of an innocent man, killing David without cause?\u201d

VWhen the messengers came, they found the household idol in the bed, with the net of goat\u2019s hair at its head.

sI19
VSaul was told that David was at Naioth in Ramah,

Vand Saul sent messengers to seize David. They saw a band of prophets speaking in ecstasy, with Samuel standing by as their leader; and the spirit of God came upon Saul\u2019s messengers and they too began to speak in ecstasy.

sI21
VWhen Saul was told about this, he sent other messengers; but they too spoke in ecstasy. Saul sent a third group of messengers; and they also spoke in ecstasy.

VSo he himself went to Ramah. When he came to the great cistern at Secu, he asked, \u201cWhere are Samuel and David?\u201d and was told that they were at Naioth in Ramah.

VHe was on his way there, to Naioth in Ramah, when the spirit of God came upon him too; and he walked on, speaking in ecstasy, until he reached Naioth in Ramah.
p7907

VThen he too stripped off his clothes and he too spoke in ecstasy before Samuel; and he lay naked all that day and all night. That is why people say, \u201cIs Saul too among the prophets?\u201d

VDavid swore further, \u201cYour father knows well that you are fond of me and has decided: Jonathan must not learn of this or he will be grieved. But, as the Lord lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death.\u201d
p7912

VJonathan said to David, \u201cWhatever you want, I will do it for you.\u201d
p7913

p7914
sI6
VIf your father notes my absence, you say, \u2018David asked my permission to run down to his home town, Bethlehem, for the whole family has its annual sacrifice there.\u2019

VIf he says \u2018Good,\u2019 your servant is safe; but if his anger flares up, know that he is resolved to do [me] harm.
p7916

VDeal faithfully with your servant, since you have taken your servant into a covenant of the Lord with you. And if I am guilty, kill me yourself, but don\u2019t make me go back to your father.\u201d

VJonathan replied, \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that! If I learn that my father has resolved to kill you, I will surely tell you about it.\u201d
p7918
sI10
VDavid said to Jonathan, \u201cWho will tell me if your father answers you harshly?\u201d
p7919
sI11
VJonathan said to David, \u201cLet us go into the open\u201d; and they both went out into the open.
p7920
sI12
VThen Jonathan said to David, \u201cBy the Lord, the God of Israel! I will sound out my father at this time tomorrow, [or] on the third day; and if [his response] is favorable for David, I will send a message to you at once and disclose it to you.
p7921
sI13
VBut if my father intends to do you harm, may the Lord do thus to Jonathan and more if I do [not] disclose it to you and send you off to escape unharmed. May the Lord be with you, as He used to be with my father.
p7922
sI14
VNor shall you fail to show me the Lord\u2019s faithfulness, while I am alive; nor, when I am dead,
p7923

Vshall you ever discontinue your faithfulness to my house\u2014not even after the Lord has wiped out every one of David\u2019s enemies from the face of the earth.

sI16
VThus has Jonathan covenanted with the house of David; and may the Lord requite the enemies of David!\u201d
p7925
sI17
VJonathan, out of his love for David, adjured him again, for he loved him as himself.
p7926
sI18
VJonathan said to him, \u201cTomorrow will be the new moon; and you will be missed when your seat remains vacant.
p7927
sI19
VSo the day after tomorrow, go down all the way to the place where you hid the other time, and stay close to the Ezel stone.
p7928
sI20
VNow I will shoot three arrows to one side of it, as though I were shooting at a mark,

p7934

VThat day, however, Saul said nothing. \u201cIt\u2019s accidental,\u201d he thought. \u201cHe must be unclean and not yet cleansed.\u201d
p7935
sI27
VBut on the day after the new moon, the second day, David\u2019s place was vacant again. So Saul said to his son Jonathan, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the son of Jesse come to the meal yesterday or today?\u201d
p7936
sI28
VJonathan answered Saul, \u201cDavid begged leave of me to go to Bethlehem.
p7937
sI29
VHe said, \u2018Please let me go, for we are going to have a family feast in our town and my brother has summoned me to it. Do me a favor, let me slip away to see my kinsmen.\u2019 That is why he has not come to the king\u2019s table.\u201d
p7938
sI30
VSaul flew into a rage against Jonathan. \u201cYou son of a perverse, rebellious woman!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI know that you side with the son of Jesse\u2014to your shame, and to the shame of your mother\u2019s nakedness!
p7939
sI31
VFor as long as the son of Jesse lives on earth, neither you nor your kingship will be secure. Now then, have him brought to me, for he is marked for death.\u201d
p7940
sI32
VBut Jonathan spoke up and said to his father, \u201cWhy should he be put to death? What has he done?\u201d
p7941
sI33
VAt that, Saul threw his spear at him to strike him down; and Jonathan realized that his father was determined to do away with David.
p7942
sI34
VJonathan rose from the table in a rage. He ate no food on the second day of the new moon, because he was grieved about David, and because his father had humiliated him.

VIn the morning, Jonathan went out into the open for the meeting with David, accompanied by a young boy.

VDavid went to the priest Ahimelech at Nob. Ahimelech came out in alarm to meet David, and he said to him, \u201cWhy are you alone, and no one with you?\u201d
p7954
sI3
VDavid answered the priest Ahimelech, \u201cThe king has ordered me on a mission, and he said to me, \u2018No one must know anything about the mission on which I am sending you and for which I have given you orders.\u2019 So I have directed [my] young men to such and such a place.
p7955
sI4
VNow then, what have you got on hand? Any loaves of bread? Let me have them\u2014or whatever is available.\u201d
p7956
sI5
VThe priest answered David, \u201cI have no ordinary bread on hand; there is only consecrated bread\u2014provided the young men have kept away from women.\u201d
p7957
sI6
VIn reply to the priest, David said, \u201cI assure you that women have been kept from us, as always. Whenever I went on a mission, even if the journey was a common one, the vessels of the young men were consecrated; all the more then may consecrated food be put into their vessels today.\u201d
p7958
sI7
VSo the priest gave him consecrated bread, because there was none there except the bread of display, which had been removed from the presence of the Lord, to be replaced by warm bread as soon as it was taken away.\u2014
p7959
sI8
VNow one of Saul\u2019s officials was there that day, detained before the Lord; his name was Doeg the Edomite, Saul\u2019s chief herdsman.
p7960
sI9
VDavid said to Ahimelech, \u201cHaven\u2019t you got a spear or sword on hand? I didn\u2019t take my sword or any of my weapons with me, because the king\u2019s mission was urgent.\u201d
p7961
sI10
VThe priest said, \u201cThere is the sword of Goliath the Philistine whom you slew in the valley of Elah; it is over there, wrapped in a cloth, behind the ephod. If you want to take that one, take it, for there is none here but that one.\u201d David replied, \u201cThere is none like it; give it to me.\u201d
p7962
sI11
VThat day David continued on his flight from Saul and he came to King Achish of Gath.
p7963
sI12
VThe courtiers of Achish said to him, \u201cWhy, that\u2019s David, king of the land! That\u2019s the one of whom they sing as they dance:Saul has slain his thousands;David, his tens of thousands.\u201d
p7964
sI13
VThese words worried David and he became very much afraid of King Achish of Gath.
p7965
sI14
VSo he concealed his good sense from them; he feigned madness for their benefit. He scratched marks on the doors of the gate and let his saliva run down his beard.
p7966
sI15
VAnd Achish said to his courtiers, \u201cYou see the man is raving; why bring him to me?

VSo he led them to the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David remained in the stronghold.

sI7
VSaul said to the courtiers standing about him, \u201cListen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give fields and vineyards to every one of you? And will he make all of you captains of thousands or captains of hundreds?
p7976
sI8
VIs that why all of you have conspired against me? For no one informs me when my own son makes a pact with the son of Jesse; no one is concerned for me and no one informs me when my own son has set my servant in ambush against me, as is now the case.\u201d
p7977
sI9
VDoeg the Edomite, who was standing among the courtiers of Saul, spoke up: \u201cI saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.
p7978
sI10
VHe inquired of the Lord on his behalf and gave him provisions; he also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.\u201d
p7979

Vand Saul said, \u201cListen to me, son of Ahitub.\u201d \u201cYes, my lord,\u201d he replied.
p7981

VAnd Saul said to him, \u201cWhy have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me? You gave him food and a sword, and inquired of God for him\u2014that he may rise in ambush against me, as is now the case.\u201d
p7982
sI14
VAhimelech replied to the king, \u201cBut who is there among all your courtiers as trusted as David, son-in-law of Your Majesty and obedient to your bidding, and esteemed in your household?
p7983
sI15
VThis is the first time that I inquired of God for him; I have done no wrong. Let not Your Majesty find fault with his servant [or] with any of my father\u2019s house; for your servant knew nothing whatever about all this.\u201d
p7984

VBut the king said, \u201cYou shall die, Ahimelech, you and all your father\u2019s house.\u201d
p7985

VAnd the king commanded the guards standing by, \u201cTurn about and kill the priests of the Lord, for they are in league with David; they knew he was running away and they did not inform me.\u201d But the king\u2019s servants would not raise a hand to strike down the priests of the Lord.
p7986
sI18
VThereupon the king said to Doeg, \u201cYou, Doeg, go and strike down the priests.\u201d And Doeg the Edomite went and struck down the priests himself; that day, he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.
p7987

VHe put Nob, the town of the priests, to the sword: men and women, children and infants, oxen, asses, and sheep\u2014[all] to the sword.

VDavid consulted the Lord, \u201cShall I go and attack those Philistines?\u201d And the Lord said to David, \u201cGo; attack the Philistines and you will save Keilah.\u201d
p7995
sI3
VBut David\u2019s men said to him, \u201cLook, we are afraid here in Judah, how much more if we go to Keilah against the forces of the Philistines!\u201d
p7996
sI4
VSo David consulted the Lord again, and the Lord answered him, \u201cMarch down at once to Keilah, for I am going to deliver the Philistines into your hands.\u201d
p7997
sI5
VDavid and his men went to Keilah and fought against the Philistines; he drove off their cattle and inflicted a severe defeat on them. Thus David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
p7998
sI6
VWhen Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he brought down an ephod with him.
p7999
sI7
VSaul was told that David had come to Keilah, and Saul thought, \u201cGod has delivered him into my hands, for he has shut himself in by entering a town with gates and bars.\u201d
p8000
sI8
VSaul summoned all the troops for war, to go down to Keilah and besiege David and his men.
p8001
sI9
VWhen David learned that Saul was planning to harm him, he told the priest Abiathar to bring the ephod forward.
p8002
sI10
VAnd David said, \u201cO Lord, God of Israel, Your servant has heard that Saul intends to come to Keilah and destroy the town because of me.
p8003
sI11
VWill the citizens of Keilah deliver me into his hands? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O Lord, God of Israel, tell Your servant!\u201d And the Lord said, \u201cHe will.\u201d
p8004

VDavid continued, \u201cWill the citizens of Keilah deliver me and my men into Saul\u2019s hands?\u201d And the Lord answered, \u201cThey will.\u201d
p8005

VSo David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah at once and moved about wherever they could. And when Saul was told that David had got away from Keilah, he did not set out.
p8006
sI14
VDavid was staying in the strongholds of the wilderness [of Judah]; he stayed in the hill country, in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul searched for him constantly, but God did not deliver him into his hands.
p8007
sI15
VDavid was once at Horesh in the wilderness of Ziph, when David learned that Saul had come out to seek his life.
p8008
sI16
VAnd Saul\u2019s son Jonathan came to David at Horesh and encouraged him in [the name of] God.
p8009
sI17
VHe said to him, \u201cDo not be afraid: the hand of my father Saul will never touch you. You are going to be king over Israel and I shall be second to you; and even my father Saul knows this is so.\u201d
p8010
sI18
VAnd the two of them entered into a pact before the Lord. David remained in Horesh, and Jonathan went home.
p8011
sI19
VSome Ziphites went up to Saul in Gibeah and said, \u201cDavid is hiding among us in the strongholds of Horesh, at the hill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon.
p8012
sI20
VSo if Your Majesty has the desire to come down, come down, and it will be our task to deliver him into Your Majesty\u2019s hands.\u201d
p8013

VAnd Saul replied, \u201cMay you be blessed of the Lord for the compassion you have shown me!
p8014
sI22
VGo now and prepare further. Look around and learn what places he sets foot on [and] who has seen him there, for I have been told he is a very cunning fellow.
p8015
sI23
VLook around and learn in which of all his hiding places he has been hiding, and return to me when you are certain. I will then go with you, and if he is in the region, I will search him out among all the clans of Judah.\u201d
p8016
sI24
VThey left at once for Ziph, ahead of Saul; David and his men were then in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah, to the south of Jeshimon.
p8017
sI25
VWhen Saul and his men came to search, David was told about it; and he went down to the rocky region and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. On hearing this, Saul pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.
p8018
sI26
VSaul was making his way along one side of a hill, and David and his men were on the other side of the hill. David was trying hard to elude Saul, and Saul and his men were trying to encircle David and his men and capture them,
p8019
sI27
Vwhen a messenger came and told Saul, \u201cCome quickly, for the Philistines have invaded the land.\u201d
p8020

VSaul gave up his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why that place came to be called the Rock of Separation.

(dp8022

VDavid went from there and stayed in the wildernesses of En-gedi.
p8023

VWhen Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told that David was in the wilderness of En-gedi.
p8024
sI3
VSo Saul took three thousand picked men from all Israel and went in search of David and his men in the direction of the rocks of the wild goats;
p8025
sI4
Vand he came to the sheepfolds along the way. There was a cave there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the back of the cave.
p8026

VDavid\u2019s men said to him, \u201cThis is the day of which the Lord said to you, \u2018I will deliver your enemy into your hands; you can do with him as you please.\u2019\ufeff\u201d David went and stealthily cut off the corner of Saul\u2019s cloak.
p8027
sI6
VBut afterward David reproached himself for cutting off the corner of Saul\u2019s cloak.
p8028
sI7
VHe said to his men, \u201cThe Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my lord\u2014the Lord\u2019s anointed\u2014that I should raise my hand against him; for he is the Lord\u2019s anointed.\u201d
p8029
sI8
VDavid rebuked his men and did not permit them to attack Saul.Saul left the cave and started on his way.
p8030
sI9
VThen David also went out of the cave and called after Saul, \u201cMy lord king!\u201d Saul looked around and David bowed low in homage, with his face to the ground.
p8031
sI10
VAnd David said to Saul, \u201cWhy do you listen to the people who say, \u2018David is out to do you harm?\u2019
p8032
sI11
VYou can see for yourself now that the Lord delivered you into my hands in the cave today. And though I was urged to kill you, I showed you pity; for I said, \u2018I will not raise a hand against my lord, since he is the Lord\u2019s anointed.\u2019
p8033
sI12
VPlease, sir, take a close look at the corner of your cloak in my hand; for when I cut off the corner of your cloak, I did not kill you. You must see plainly that I have done nothing evil or rebellious, and I have never wronged you. Yet you are bent on taking my life.

VMay the Lord judge between you and me! And may He take vengeance upon you for me, but my hand will never touch you.

VWhen David finished saying these things to Saul, Saul said, \u201cIs that your voice, my son David?\u201d And Saul broke down and wept.
p8039
sI18
VHe said to David, \u201cYou are right, not I; for you have treated me generously, but I have treated you badly.
p8040
sI19
VYes, you have just revealed how generously you treated me, for the Lord delivered me into your hands and you did not kill me.

VIf a man meets his enemy, does he let him go his way unharmed? Surely, the Lord will reward you generously for what you have done for me this day.

VAnd when the Lord has accomplished for my lord all the good He has promised you, and has appointed you ruler of Israel,

VThe Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah and said, \u201cDavid is hiding in the hill of Hachilah facing Jeshimon.\u201d
p8092
sI2
VSaul went down at once to the wilderness of Ziph, together with three thousand picked men of Israel, to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph,
p8093
sI3
Vand Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah which faces Jeshimon, by the road. When David, who was then living in the wilderness, learned that Saul had come after him into the wilderness,
p8094
sI4
VDavid sent out scouts and made sure that Saul had come.
p8095
sI5
VDavid went at once to the place where Saul had encamped, and David saw the spot where Saul and his army commander, Abner son of Ner, lay asleep. Saul lay asleep inside the barricade and the troops were posted around him.
p8096
sI6
VDavid spoke up and asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab\u2019s brother, \u201cWho will go down with me into the camp to Saul?\u201d And Abishai answered, \u201cI will go down with you.\u201d
p8097
sI7
VSo David and Abishai approached the troops by night, and found Saul fast asleep inside the barricade, his spear stuck in the ground at his head, and Abner and the troops sleeping around him.
p8098
sI8
VAnd Abishai said to David, \u201cGod has delivered your enemy into your hands today. Let me pin him to the ground with a single thrust of the spear. I will not have to strike him twice.\u201d
p8099
sI9
VBut David said to Abishai, \u201cDon\u2019t do him violence! No one can lay hands on the Lord\u2019s anointed with impunity.\u201d
p8100
sI10
VAnd David went on, \u201cAs the Lord lives, the Lord Himself will strike him down, or his time will come and he will die, or he will go down to battle and perish.
p8101
sI11
VBut the Lord forbid that I should lay a hand on the Lord\u2019s anointed! Just take the spear and the water jar at his head and let\u2019s be off.\u201d
p8102
sI12
VSo David took away the spear and the water jar at Saul\u2019s head, and they left. No one saw or knew or woke up; all remained asleep; a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them.
p8103
sI13
VDavid crossed over to the other side and stood afar on top of a hill; there was considerable distance between them.
p8104
sI14
VAnd David shouted to the troops and to Abner son of Ner, \u201cAbner, aren\u2019t you going to answer?\u201d And Abner shouted back, \u201cWho are you to shout at the king?\u201d
p8105
sI15
VAnd David answered Abner, \u201cYou are a man, aren\u2019t you? And there is no one like you in Israel! So why didn\u2019t you keep watch over your lord the king? For one of [our] troops came to do violence to your lord the king.
p8106
sI16
VYou have not given a good account of yourself! As the Lord lives, [all of] you deserve to die, because you did not keep watch over your lord, the Lord\u2019s anointed. Look around, where are the king\u2019s spear and the water jar that were at his head?\u201d
p8107
sI17
VSaul recognized David\u2019s voice, and he asked, \u201cIs that your voice, my son David?\u201d And David replied, \u201cIt is, my lord king.\u201d
p8108
sI18
VAnd he went on, \u201cBut why does my lord continue to pursue his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of?
p8109
sI19
VNow let my lord the king hear his servant out. If the Lord has incited you against me, let Him be appeased by an offering; but if it is men, may they be accursed of the Lord! For they have driven me out today, so that I cannot have a share in the Lord\u2019s possession, but am told, \u2018Go and worship other gods.\u2019
p8110
sI20
VOh, let my blood not fall to the ground, away from the presence of the Lord! For the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea\u2014as if he were hunting a partridge in the hills.\u201d
p8111
sI21
VAnd Saul answered, \u201cI am in the wrong. Come back, my son David, for I will never harm you again, seeing how you have held my life precious this day. Yes, I have been a fool, and I have erred so very much.\u201d
p8112
sI22
VDavid replied, \u201cHere is Your Majesty\u2019s spear. Let one of the young men come over and get it.
p8113
sI23
VAnd the Lord will requite every man for his right conduct and loyalty\u2014for this day the Lord delivered you into my hands and I would not raise a hand against the Lord\u2019s anointed.
p8114
sI24
VAnd just as I valued your life highly this day, so may the Lord value my life and may He rescue me from all trouble.\u201d
p8115
sI25
VSaul answered David, \u201cMay you be blessed, my son David. You shall achieve, and you shall prevail.\u201dDavid then went his way, and Saul returned home.
p8116

(dp8117

VDavid said to himself, \u201cSome day I shall certainly perish at the hands of Saul. The best thing for me is to flee to the land of the Philistines; Saul will then give up hunting me throughout the territory of Israel, and I will escape him.\u201d
p8118
sI2
VSo David and the six hundred men with him went and crossed over to King Achish son of Maoch of Gath.
p8119
sI3
VDavid and his men stayed with Achish in Gath, each man with his family, and David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
p8120
sI4
VAnd when Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he did not pursue him any more.
p8121
sI5
VDavid said to Achish, \u201cIf you please, let a place be granted me in one of the country towns where I can live; why should your servant remain with you in the royal city?\u201d
p8122
sI6
VAt that time Achish granted him Ziklag; that is how Ziklag came to belong to the kings of Judah, as is still the case.
p8123
sI7
VThe length of time that David lived in Philistine territory was a year and four months.
p8124
sI8
VDavid and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Gizrites, and the Amalekites\u2014who were the inhabitants of the region of Olam, all the way to Shur and to the land of Egypt.\u2014
p8125
sI9
VWhen David attacked a region, he would leave no man or woman alive; he would take flocks, herds, asses, camels, and clothing. When he returned and came to Achish,
p8126
sI10
VAchish would ask, \u201cWhere did you raid today?\u201d and David would reply, \u201cThe Negeb of Judah,\u201d or \u201cthe Negeb of the Jerahmeelites,\u201d or \u201cthe Negeb of the Kenites.\u201d
p8127
sI11
VDavid would leave no man or woman alive to be brought to Gath; for he thought, \u201cThey might tell about us: David did this.\u201d Such was his practice as long as he stayed in the territory of the Philistines.
p8128
sI12
VAchish trusted David. He thought: \u201cHe has aroused the wrath of his own people Israel, and so he will be my vassal forever.\u201d
p8129
ssI28
(dp8130
I1
VAt that time the Philistines mustered their forces for war, to take the field against Israel. Achish said to David, \u201cYou know, of course, that you and your men must march out with my forces.\u201d
p8131
sI2
VDavid answered Achish, \u201cYou surely know what your servant will do.\u201d \u201cIn that case,\u201d Achish replied to David, \u201cI will appoint you my bodyguard for life.\u201d

VNow Samuel had died and all Israel made lament for him; and he was buried in his own town of Ramah. And Saul had forbidden [recourse to] ghosts and familiar spirits in the land.
p8133
sI4
VThe Philistines mustered and they marched to Shunem and encamped; and Saul gathered all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa.
p8134
sI5
VWhen Saul saw the Philistine force, his heart trembled with fear.
p8135
sI6
VAnd Saul inquired of the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets.
p8136
sI7
VThen Saul said to his courtiers, \u201cFind me a woman who consults ghosts, so that I can go to her and inquire through her.\u201d And his courtiers told him that there was a woman in En-dor who consulted ghosts.
p8137
sI8
VSaul disguised himself; he put on different clothes and set out with two men. They came to the woman by night, and he said, \u201cPlease divine for me by a ghost. Bring up for me the one I shall name to you.\u201d
p8138
sI9
VBut the woman answered him, \u201cYou know what Saul has done, how he has banned [the use of] ghosts and familiar spirits in the land. So why are you laying a trap for me, to get me killed?\u201d
p8139
sI10
VSaul swore to her by the Lord: \u201cAs the Lord lives, you won\u2019t get into trouble over this.\u201d
p8140
sI11
VAt that, the woman asked, \u201cWhom shall I bring up for you?\u201d He answered, \u201cBring up Samuel for me.\u201d
p8141
sI12
VThen the woman recognized Samuel, and she shrieked loudly, and said to Saul, \u201cWhy have you deceived me? You are Saul!\u201d
p8142
sI13
VThe king answered her, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. What do you see?\u201d And the woman said to Saul, \u201cI see a divine being coming up from the earth.\u201d
p8143
sI14
V\u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d he asked her. \u201cIt is an old man coming up,\u201d she said, \u201cand he is wrapped in a robe.\u201d Then Saul knew that it was Samuel; and he bowed low in homage with his face to the ground.
p8144
sI15
VSamuel said to Saul, \u201cWhy have you disturbed me and brought me up?\u201d And Saul answered, \u201cI am in great trouble. The Philistines are attacking me and God has turned away from me; He no longer answers me, either by prophets or in dreams. So I have called you to tell me what I am to do.\u201d
p8145
sI16
VSamuel said, \u201cWhy do you ask me, seeing that the Lord has turned away from you and has become your adversary?
p8146
sI17
VThe Lord has done for Himself as He foretold through me: The Lord has torn the kingship out of your hands and has given it to your fellow, to David,
p8147
sI18
Vbecause you did not obey the Lord and did not execute His wrath upon the Amalekites. That is why the Lord has done this to you today.
p8148
sI19
VFurther, the Lord will deliver the Israelites who are with you into the hands of the Philistines. Tomorrow your sons and you will be with me; and the Lord will also deliver the Israelite forces into the hands of the Philistines.\u201d
p8149
sI20
VAt once Saul flung himself prone on the ground, terrified by Samuel\u2019s words. Besides, there was no strength in him, for he had not eaten anything all day and all night.
p8150
sI21
VThe woman went up to Saul and, seeing how greatly disturbed he was, she said to him, \u201cYour handmaid listened to you; I took my life in my hands and heeded the request you made of me.
p8151
sI22
VSo now you listen to me: Let me set before you a bit of food. Eat, and then you will have the strength to go on your way.\u201d
p8152
sI23
VHe refused, saying, \u201cI will not eat.\u201d But when his courtiers as well as the woman urged him, he listened to them; he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.
p8153
sI24
VThe woman had a stall-fed calf in the house; she hastily slaughtered it, and took flour and kneaded it, and baked some unleavened cakes.
p8154
sI25
VShe set this before Saul and his courtiers, and they ate. Then they rose and left the same night.

VThe Philistines mustered all their forces at Aphek, while Israel was encamping at the spring in Jezreel.
p8157
sI2
VThe Philistine lords came marching, each with his units of hundreds and of thousands; and David and his men came marching last, with Achish.
p8158
sI3
VThe Philistine officers asked, \u201cWho are those Hebrews?\u201d \u201cWhy, that\u2019s David, the servant of King Saul of Israel,\u201d Achish answered the Philistine officers. \u201cHe has been with me for a year or more, and I have found no fault in him from the day he defected until now.\u201d
p8159
sI4
VBut the Philistine officers were angry with him; and the Philistine officers said to him, \u201cSend the man back; let him go back to the place you assigned him. He shall not march down with us to the battle, or else he may become our adversary in battle. For with what could that fellow appease his master if not with the heads of these men?
p8160
sI5
VRemember, he is the David of whom they sang as they danced:Saul has slain his thousands;David, his tens of thousands.\u201d
p8161
sI6
VAchish summoned David and said to him, \u201cAs the Lord lives, you are an honest man, and I would like to have you serve in my forces; for I have found no fault with you from the day you joined me until now. But you are not acceptable to the other lords.
p8162
sI7
VSo go back in peace, and do nothing to displease the Philistine lords.\u201d
p8163
sI8
VDavid, however, said to Achish, \u201cBut what have I done, what fault have you found in your servant from the day I appeared before you to this day, that I should not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?\u201d
p8164
sI9
VAchish replied to David, \u201cI know; you are as acceptable to me as an angel of God. But the Philistine officers have decided that you must not march out with us to the battle.
p8165
sI10
VSo rise early in the morning, you and your lord\u2019s servants who came with you\u2014rise early in the morn- ing, and leave as soon as it is light.\u201d
p8166

VAccordingly, David and his men rose early in the morning to leave, to return to the land of the Philistines, while the Philistines marched up to Jezreel.

VBy the time David and his men arrived in Ziklag, on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid into the Negeb and against Ziklag; they had stormed Ziklag and burned it down.
p8169
sI2
VThey had taken the women in it captive, low-born and high-born alike; they did not kill any, but carried them off and went their way.
p8170
sI3
VWhen David and his men came to the town and found it burned down, and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive,
p8171
sI4
VDavid and the troops with him broke into tears, until they had no strength left for weeping.
p8172
sI5
VDavid\u2019s two wives had been taken captive, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail wife of Nabal from Carmel.
p8173
sI6
VDavid was in great danger, for the troops threatened to stone him; for all the troops were embittered on account of their sons and daughters.But David sought strength in the Lord his God.
p8174
sI7
VDavid said to the priest Abiathar son of Ahimelech, \u201cBring the ephod up to me.\u201d When Abiathar brought up the ephod to David,
p8175
sI8
VDavid inquired of the Lord, \u201cShall I pursue those raiders? Will I overtake them?\u201d And He answered him, \u201cPursue, for you shall overtake and you shall rescue.\u201d
p8176
sI9
VSo David and the six hundred men with him set out, and they came to the Wadi Besor, where a halt was made by those who were to be left behind.
p8177
sI10
VDavid continued the pursuit with four hundred men; two hundred men had halted, too faint to cross the Wadi Besor.
p8178
sI11
VThey came upon an Egyptian in the open country and brought him to David. They gave him food to eat and water to drink;
p8179
sI12
Vhe was also given a piece of pressed fig cake and two cakes of raisins. He ate and regained his strength, for he had eaten no food and drunk no water for three days and three nights.
p8180
sI13
VThen David asked him, \u201cTo whom do you belong and where are you from?\u201d \u201cI am an Egyptian boy,\u201d he answered, \u201cthe slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I fell ill three days ago.
p8181
sI14
VWe had raided the Negeb of the Cherethites, and [the Negeb] of Judah, and the Negeb of Caleb; we also burned down Ziklag.\u201d
p8182
sI15
VAnd David said to him, \u201cCan you lead me down to that band?\u201d He replied, \u201cSwear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into my master\u2019s hands, and I will lead you down to that band.\u201d
p8183
sI16
VSo he led him down, and there they were, scattered all over the ground, eating and drinking and making merry because of all the vast spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
p8184
sI17
VDavid attacked them from before dawn until the evening of the next day; none of them escaped, except four hundred young men who mounted camels and got away.
p8185
sI18
VDavid rescued everything the Amalekites had taken; David also rescued his two wives.
p8186
sI19
VNothing of theirs was missing\u2014young or old, sons or daughters, spoil or anything else that had been carried off\u2014David recovered everything.
p8187
sI20
VDavid took all the flocks and herds, which [the troops] drove ahead of the other livestock; and they declared, \u201cThis is David\u2019s spoil.\u201d
p8188
sI21
VWhen David reached the two hundred men who were too faint to follow David and who had been left at the Wadi Besor, they came out to welcome David and the troops with him; David came forward with the troops and greeted them.
p8189
sI22
VBut all the mean and churlish fellows among the men who had accompanied David spoke up, \u201cSince they did not accompany us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we seized\u2014except that each may take his wife and children and go.\u201d
p8190
sI23
VDavid, however, spoke up, \u201cYou must not do that, my brothers, in view of what the Lord has granted us, guarding us and delivering into our hands the band that attacked us.
p8191
sI24
VHow could anyone agree with you in this matter? The share of those who remain with the baggage shall be the same as the share of those who go down to battle; they shall share alike.\u201d
p8192
sI25
VSo from that day on it was made a fixed rule for Israel, continuing to the present day.
p8193

VWhen David reached Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah [and] to his friends, saying, \u201cThis is a present for you from our spoil of the enemies of the Lord.\u201d

VAbsalom didn\u2019t utter a word to Amnon, good or bad; but Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar.
p8546
sI23
VTwo years later, when Absalom was having his flocks sheared at Baal-hazor near Ephraim, Absalom invited all the king\u2019s sons.
p8547
sI24
VAnd Absalom came to the king and said, \u201cYour servant is having his flocks sheared. Would Your Majesty and your retinue accompany your servant?\u201d
p8548
sI25
VBut the king answered Absalom, \u201cNo, my son. We must not all come, or we\u2019ll be a burden to you.\u201d He urged him, but he would not go, and he said good-bye to him.
p8549
sI26
VThereupon Absalom said, \u201cIn that case, let my brother Amnon come with us,\u201d to which the king replied, \u201cHe shall not go with you.\u201d
p8550
sI27
VBut Absalom urged him, and he sent with him Amnon and all the other princes.
p8551
sI28
VNow Absalom gave his attendants these orders: \u201cWatch, and when Amnon is merry with wine and I tell you to strike down Amnon, kill him! Don\u2019t be afraid, for it is I who give you the order. Act with determination, like brave men!\u201d
p8552
sI29
VAbsalom\u2019s attendants did to Amnon as Absalom had ordered; whereupon all the other princes mounted their mules and fled.
p8553
sI30
VThey were still on the road when a rumor reached David that Absalom had killed all the princes, and that not one of them had survived.
p8554
sI31
VAt this, David rent his garment and lay down on the ground, and all his courtiers stood by with their clothes rent.
p8555
sI32
VBut Jonadab, the son of David\u2019s brother Shimah, said, \u201cMy lord must not think that all the young princes have been killed. Only Amnon is dead; for this has been decided by Absalom ever since his sister Tamar was violated.
p8556
sI33
VSo my lord the king must not think for a moment that all the princes are dead; Amnon alone is dead.\u201d
p8557
sI34
VMeanwhile Absalom had fled.The watchman on duty looked up and saw a large crowd coming from the road to his rear, from the side of the hill.
p8558
sI35
VJonadab said to the king, \u201cSee, the princes have come! It is just as your servant said.\u201d
p8559
sI36
VAs he finished speaking, the princes came in and broke into weeping; and David and all his courtiers wept bitterly, too.
p8560
sI37
VAbsalom had fled, and he came to Talmai son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [King David] mourned over his son a long time.
p8561
sI38
VAbsalom, who had fled to Geshur, remained there three years.
p8562

VAnd King David was pining away for Absalom, for [the king] had gotten over Amnon\u2019s death.

VJoab son of Zeruiah could see that the king\u2019s mind was on Absalom;
p8565
sI2
Vso Joab sent to Tekoa and brought a clever woman from there. He said to her, \u201cPretend you are in mourning; put on mourning clothes and don\u2019t anoint yourself with oil; and act like a woman who has grieved a long time over a departed one.
p8566
sI3
VGo to the king and say to him thus and thus.\u201d And Joab told her what to say.
p8567
sI4
VThe woman of Tekoa came to the king, flung herself face down to the ground, and prostrated herself. She cried out, \u201cHelp, O king!\u201d
p8568
sI5
VThe king asked her, \u201cWhat troubles you?\u201d And she answered, \u201cAlas, I am a widow, my husband is dead.
p8569
sI6
VYour maidservant had two sons. The two of them came to blows out in the fields where there was no one to stop them, and one of them struck the other and killed him.
p8570
sI7
VThen the whole clan confronted your maidservant and said, \u2018Hand over the one who killed his brother, that we may put him to death for the slaying of his brother, even though we wipe out the heir.\u2019 Thus they would quench the last ember remaining to me, and leave my husband without name or remnant upon the earth.\u201d
p8571
sI8
VThe king said to the woman, \u201cGo home. I will issue an order in your behalf.\u201d
p8572
sI9
VAnd the woman of Tekoa said to the king, \u201cMy lord king, may the guilt be on me and on my ancestral house; Your Majesty and his throne are guiltless.\u201d
p8573
sI10
VThe king said, \u201cIf anyone says anything more to you, have him brought to me, and he will never trouble you again.\u201d
p8574
sI11
VShe replied, \u201cLet Your Majesty be mindful of the Lord your God and restrain the blood avenger bent on destruction, so that my son may not be killed.\u201d And he said, \u201cAs the Lord lives, not a hair of your son shall fall to the ground.\u201d
p8575
sI12
VThen the woman said, \u201cPlease let your maidservant say another word to my lord the king.\u201d \u201cSpeak on,\u201d said the king.
p8576
sI13
VAnd the woman said, \u201cWhy then have you planned the like against God\u2019s people? In making this pronouncement, Your Majesty condemns himself in that Your Majesty does not bring back his own banished one.
p8577
sI14
VWe must all die; we are like water that is poured out on the ground and cannot be gathered up. God will not take away the life of one who makes plans so that no one may be kept banished.
p8578
sI15
VAnd the reason I have come to say these things to the king, my lord, is that the people have frightened me. Your maidservant thought I would speak to Your Majesty; perhaps Your Majesty would act on his handmaid\u2019s plea.
p8579
sI16
VFor Your Majesty would surely agree to deliver his handmaid from the hands of anyone [who would seek to] cut off both me and my son from the heritage of God.
p8580
sI17
VYour maidservant thought, \u2018Let the word of my lord the king provide comfort; for my lord the king is like an angel of God, understanding everything, good and bad.\u2019 May the Lord your God be with you.\u201d
p8581
sI18
VIn reply, the king said to the woman, \u201cDo not withhold from me anything I ask you!\u201d The woman answered, \u201cLet my lord the king speak.\u201d
p8582
sI19
VThe king asked, \u201cIs Joab in league with you in all this?\u201d The woman replied, \u201cAs you live, my lord the king, it is just as my lord the king says. Yes, your servant Joab was the one who instructed me, and it was he who told your maidservant everything she was to say.
p8583
sI20
VIt was to conceal the real purpose of the matter that your servant Joab did this thing. My lord is as wise as an angel of God, and he knows all that goes on in the land.\u201d
p8584
sI21
VThen the king said to Joab, \u201cI will do this thing. Go and bring back my boy Absalom.\u201d
p8585
sI22
VJoab flung himself face down on the ground and prostrated himself. Joab blessed the king and said, \u201cToday your servant knows that he has found favor with you, my lord king, for Your Majesty has granted his servant\u2019s request.\u201d
p8586
sI23
VAnd Joab went at once to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
p8587
sI24
VBut the king said, \u201cLet him go directly to his house and not present himself to me.\u201d So Absalom went directly to his house and did not present himself to the king.
p8588
sI25
VNo one in all Israel was so admired for his beauty as Absalom; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head he was without blemish.
p8589
sI26
VWhen he cut his hair\u2014he had to have it cut every year, for it grew too heavy for him\u2014the hair of his head weighed two hundred shekels by the royal weight.
p8590
sI27
VAbsalom had three sons and a daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a beautiful woman.
p8591
sI28
VAbsalom lived in Jerusalem two years without appearing before the king.
p8592
sI29
VThen Absalom sent for Joab, in order to send him to the king; but Joab would not come to him. He sent for him a second time, but he would not come.
p8593
sI30
VSo [Absalom] said to his servants, \u201cLook, Joab\u2019s field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.\u201d And Absalom\u2019s servants set the field on fire.
p8594
sI31
VJoab came at once to Absalom\u2019s house and said to him, \u201cWhy did your servants set fire to my field?\u201d
p8595
sI32
VAbsalom replied to Joab, \u201cI sent for you to come here; I wanted to send you to the king to say [on my behalf]: \u2018Why did I leave Geshur? I would be better off if I were still there. Now let me appear before the king; and if I am guilty of anything, let him put me to death!\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p8596

VJoab went to the king and reported to him; whereupon he summoned Absalom. He came to the king and flung himself face down to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.

VSometime afterward, Absalom provided himself with a chariot, horses, and fifty outrunners.
p8599
sI2
VAbsalom used to rise early and stand by the road to the city gates; and whenever a man had a case that was to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call out to him, \u201cWhat town are you from?\u201d And when he answered, \u201cYour servant is from such and such a tribe in Israel,\u201d
p8600
sI3
VAbsalom would say to him, \u201cIt is clear that your claim is right and just, but there is no one assigned to you by the king to hear it.\u201d
p8601
sI4
VAnd Absalom went on, \u201cIf only I were appointed judge in the land and everyone with a legal dispute came before me, I would see that he got his rights.\u201d
p8602
sI5
VAnd if a man approached to bow to him, [Absalom] would extend his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.
p8603
sI6
VAbsalom did this to every Israelite who came to the king for judgment. Thus Absalom won away the hearts of the men of Israel.
p8604
sI7
VAfter a period of forty years had gone by, Absalom said to the king, \u201cLet me go to Hebron and fulfill a vow that I made to the Lord.
p8605
sI8
VFor your servant made a vow when I lived in Geshur of Aram: If the Lord ever brings me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the Lord.\u201d
p8606
sI9
VThe king said to him, \u201cGo in peace\u201d; and so he set out for Hebron.
p8607
sI10
VBut Absalom sent agents to all the tribes of Israel to say, \u201cWhen you hear the blast of the horn, announce that Absalom has become king in Hebron.\u201d
p8608
sI11
VTwo hundred men of Jerusalem accompanied Absalom; they were invited and went in good faith, suspecting nothing.
p8609
sI12
VAbsalom also sent [to fetch] Ahithophel the Gilonite, David\u2019s counselor, from his town, Giloh, when the sacrifices were to be offered. The conspiracy gained strength, and the people supported Absalom in increasing numbers.
p8610
sI13
VSomeone came and told David, \u201cThe loyalty of the men of Israel has veered toward Absalom.\u201d
p8611
sI14
VWhereupon David said to all the courtiers who were with him in Jerusalem, \u201cLet us flee at once, or none of us will escape from Absalom. We must get away quickly, or he will soon overtake us and bring down disaster upon us and put the city to the sword.\u201d
p8612
sI15
VThe king\u2019s courtiers said to the king, \u201cWhatever our lord the king decides, your servants are ready.\u201d
p8613
sI16
VSo the king left, followed by his entire household, except for ten concubines whom the king left to mind the palace.
p8614
sI17
VThe king left, followed by all the people, and they stopped at the last house.
p8615
sI18
VAll his followers marched past him, including all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites; and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had accompanied him from Gath, also marched by the king.
p8616
sI19
VAnd the king said to Ittai the Gittite, \u201cWhy should you too go with us? Go back and stay with the [new] king, for you are a foreigner and you are also an exile from your country.
p8617
sI20
VYou came only yesterday; should I make you wander about with us today, when I myself must go wherever I can? Go back, and take your kinsmen with you, [in] true faithfulness.\u201d
p8618
sI21
VIttai replied to the king, \u201cAs the Lord lives and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, there your servant will be, whether for death or for life!\u201d
p8619
sI22
VAnd David said to Ittai, \u201cThen march by.\u201d And Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the children who were with him marched by.
p8620
sI23
VThe whole countryside wept aloud as the troops marched by. The king crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the troops crossed by the road to the wilderness.
p8621
sI24
VThen Zadok appeared, with all the Levites carrying the Ark of the Covenant of God; and they set down the Ark of God until all the people had finished marching out of the city. Abiathar also came up.
p8622
sI25
VBut the king said to Zadok, \u201cTake the Ark of God back to the city. If I find favor with the Lord, He will bring me back and let me see it and its abode.
p8623
sI26
VAnd if He should say, \u2018I do not want you,\u2019 I am ready; let Him do with me as He pleases.\u201d
p8624
sI27
VAnd the king said to the priest Zadok, \u201cDo you understand? You return to the safety of the city with your two sons, your own son Ahimaaz and Abiathar\u2019s son Jonathan.
p8625
sI28
VLook, I shall linger in the steppes of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.\u201d
p8626
sI29
VZadok and Abiathar brought the Ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they stayed there.
p8627
sI30
VDavid meanwhile went up the slope of the [Mount of] Olives, weeping as he went; his head was covered and he walked barefoot. And all the people who were with him covered their heads and wept as they went up.
p8628
sI31
VDavid [was] told that Ahithophel was among the conspirators with Absalom, and he prayed, \u201cPlease, O Lord, frustrate Ahithophel\u2019s counsel!\u201d
p8629
sI32
VWhen David reached the top, where people would prostrate themselves to God, Hushai the Archite was there to meet him, with his robe torn and with earth on his head.
p8630
sI33
VDavid said to him, \u201cIf you march on with me, you will be a burden to me.
p8631
sI34
VBut if you go back to the city and say to Absalom, \u2018I will be your servant, O king; I was your father\u2019s servant formerly, and now I will be yours,\u2019 then you can nullify Ahithophel\u2019s counsel for me.
p8632
sI35
VYou will have the priests Zadok and Abiathar there, and you can report everything that you hear in the king\u2019s palace to the priests Zadok and Abiathar.
p8633
sI36
VAlso, their two sons are there with them, Zadok\u2019s son Ahimaaz and Abiathar\u2019s son Jonathan; and through them you can report to me everything you hear.\u201d

p8637
sI2
VThe king asked Ziba, \u201cWhat are you doing with these?\u201d Ziba answered, \u201cThe asses are for Your Majesty\u2019s family to ride on, the bread and figs are for the attendants to eat, and the wine is to be drunk by any who are exhausted in the wilderness.\u201d
p8638

V\u201cAnd where is your master\u2019s son?\u201d the king asked. \u201cHe is staying in Jerusalem,\u201d Ziba replied to the king, \u201cfor he thinks that the House of Israel will now give him back the throne of his grandfather.\u201d
p8639
sI4

VHe threw stones at David and all King David\u2019s courtiers, while all the troops and all the warriors were at his right and his left.

VBut the king said, \u201cWhat has this to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? He is abusing [me] only because the Lord told him to abuse David; and who is to say, \u2018Why did You do that?\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p8646
sI11
VDavid said further to Abishai and all the courtiers, \u201cIf my son, my own issue, seeks to kill me, how much more the Benjaminite! Let him go on hurling abuse, for the Lord has told him to.
p8647
sI12
VPerhaps the Lord will look upon my punishment and recompense me for the abuse [Shimei] has uttered today.\u201d

sI13
VDavid and his men continued on their way, while Shimei walked alongside on the slope of the hill, insulting him as he walked, and throwing stones at him and flinging dirt.

VWhen Hushai the Archite, David\u2019s friend, came before Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, \u201cLong live the king! Long live the king!\u201d
p8652
sI17
VBut Absalom said to Hushai, \u201cIs this your loyalty to your friend? Why didn\u2019t you go with your friend?\u201d
p8653
sI18
V\u201cNot at all!\u201d Hushai replied. \u201cI am for the one whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, and I will stay with him.
p8654
sI19
VFurthermore, whom should I serve, if not David\u2019s son? As I was in your father\u2019s service, so I will be in yours.\u201d
p8655
sI20
VAbsalom then said to Ahithophel, \u201cWhat do you advise us to do?\u201d
p8656
sI21
VAnd Ahithophel said to Absalom, \u201cHave intercourse with your father\u2019s concubines, whom he left to mind the palace; and when all Israel hears that you have dared the wrath of your father, all who support you will be encouraged.\u201d
p8657

VSo they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom lay with his father\u2019s concubines with the full knowledge of all Israel.\u2014
p8658

VIn those days, the advice which Ahithophel gave was accepted like an oracle sought from God; that is how all the advice of Ahithophel was esteemed both by David and by Absalom.

sI7
VHushai said to Absalom, \u201cThis time the advice that Ahithophel has given is not good.
p8667
sI8
VYou know,\u201d Hushai continued, \u201cthat your father and his men are courageous fighters, and they are as desperate as a bear in the wild robbed of her whelps. Your father is an experienced soldier, and he will not spend the night with the troops;
p8668
sI9
Veven now he must be hiding in one of the pits or in some other place. And if any of them fall at the first attack, whoever hears of it will say, \u2018A disaster has struck the troops that follow Absalom\u2019;

VAbsalom and all Israel agreed that the advice of Hushai the Archite was better than that of Ahithophel.\u2014The Lord had decreed that Ahithophel\u2019s sound advice be nullified, in order that the Lord might bring ruin upon Absalom.
p8674

VAfter they were gone, [Ahimaaz and Jonathan] came up from the well and went and informed King David. They said to David, \u201cGo and cross the water quickly, for Ahithophel has advised thus and thus concerning you.\u201d

VDavid sent out the troops, one-third under the command of Joab, one-third under the command of Joab\u2019s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and one-third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And David said to the troops, \u201cI myself will march out with you.\u201d
p8692
sI3
VBut the troops replied, \u201cNo! For if some of us flee, the rest will not be concerned about us; even if half of us should die, the others will not be concerned about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore, it is better for you to support us from the town.\u201d
p8693

VAbsalom encountered some of David\u2019s followers. Absalom was riding on a mule, and as the mule passed under the tangled branches of a great terebinth, his hair got caught in the terebinth; he was held between heaven and earth as the mule under him kept going.
p8699
sI10
VOne of the men saw it and told Joab, \u201cI have just seen Absalom hanging from a terebinth.\u201d

sI11
VJoab said to the man who told him, \u201cYou saw it! Why didn\u2019t you kill him then and there? I would have owed you ten shekels of silver and a belt.\u201d
p8701
sI12
VBut the man answered Joab, \u201cEven if I had a thousand shekels of silver in my hands, I would not raise a hand against the king\u2019s son. For the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai in our hearing, \u2018Watch over my boy Absalom, for my sake.\u2019[cb1.5][cf11,11]-h [cb0]

VJoab replied, \u201cThen I will not wait for you.\u201d He took three darts in his hand and drove them into Absalom\u2019s chest. [Absalom] was still alive in the thick growth of the terebinth,
p8704
sI15
Vwhen ten of Joab\u2019s young arms-bearers closed in and struck at Absalom until he died.

VThey took Absalom and flung him into a large pit in the forest, and they piled up a very great heap of stones over it. Then all the Israelites fled to their homes.\u2014
p8707
sI18
VNow Absalom, in his lifetime, had taken the pillar which is in the Valley of the King and set it up for himself; for he said, \u201cI have no son to keep my name alive.\u201d He had named the pillar after himself, and it has been called Absalom\u2019s Monument to this day.

p8710
sI21
VAnd Joab said to a Cushite, \u201cGo tell the king what you have seen.\u201d The Cushite bowed to Joab and ran off.
p8711
sI22
VBut Ahimaaz son of Zadok again said to Joab, \u201cNo matter what, let me run, too, behind the Cushite.\u201d Joab asked, \u201cWhy should you run, my boy, when you have no news worth telling?\u201d
p8712
sI23
V\u201cI am going to run anyway.\u201d \u201cThen run,\u201d he said. So Ahimaaz ran by way of the Plain, and he passed the Cushite.

sI26
Vthe watchman saw another man running; and he called out to the gatekeeper, \u201cThere is another man running alone.\u201d And the king said, \u201cThat one, too, brings news.\u201d

sI27
VThe watchman said, \u201cI can see that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok\u201d; to which the king replied, \u201cHe is a good man, and he comes with good news.\u201d
p8717

VAhimaaz called out and said to the king, \u201cAll is well!\u201d He bowed low with his face to the ground and said, \u201cPraised be the Lord your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king.\u201d
p8718

VThe king asked, \u201cIs my boy Absalom safe?\u201d And Ahimaaz answered, \u201cI saw a large crowd when Your Majesty\u2019s servant Joab was sending your servant off, but I don\u2019t know what it was about.\u201d

VThe king asked the Cushite, \u201cIs my boy Absalom safe?\u201d And the Cushite replied, \u201cMay the enemies of my lord the king  and all who rose against you to do you harm fare like  that young man!\u201d

p8724
sI2
VJoab was told that the king was weeping and mourning over Absalom.

VAnd the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the troops, for that day the troops heard that the king was grieving over his son.
p8726

VThe troops stole into town that day like troops ashamed after running away in battle.

VThe king covered his face and the king kept crying aloud, \u201cO my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!\u201d
p8728
sI6
VJoab came to the king in his quarters and said, \u201cToday you have humiliated all your followers, who this day saved your life, and the lives of your sons and daughters, and the lives of your wives and concubines,
p8729
sI7
Vby showing love for those who hate you and hate for those who love you. For you have made clear today that the officers and men mean nothing to you. I am sure that if Absalom were alive today and the rest of us dead, you would have preferred it.
p8730
sI8
VNow arise, come out and placate your followers! For I swear by the Lord that if you do not come out, not a single man will remain with you overnight; and that would be a greater disaster for you than any disaster that has befallen you from your youth until now.\u201d

VAll the people throughout the tribes of Israel were arguing: Some said, \u201cThe king saved us from the hands of our enemies, and he delivered us from the hands of the Philistines; and just now he had to flee the country because of Absalom.
p8733
sI11
VBut Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle; why then do you sit idle instead of escorting the king back?\u201d
p8734
sI12
VThe talk of all Israel reached the king in his quarters. So King David sent this message to the priests Zadok and Abiathar: \u201cSpeak to the elders of Judah and say, \u2018Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace?
p8735
sI13
VYou are my kinsmen, my own flesh and blood! Why should you be the last to escort the king back?\u2019

VHe said to the king, \u201cLet not my lord hold me guilty, and do not remember the wrong your servant committed on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem; let Your Majesty give it no thought.
p8743
sI21
VFor your servant knows that he has sinned; so here I have come down today, the first of all the House of Joseph, to meet my lord the king.\u201d

VThereupon Abishai son of Zeruiah spoke up, \u201cShouldn\u2019t Shimei be put to death for that\u2014insulting the Lord\u2019s anointed?\u201d
p8745
sI23
VBut David said, \u201cWhat has this to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should cross me today? Should a single Israelite be put to death today? Don\u2019t I know that today I am again king over Israel?\u201d

VWhen he came [from] Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come with me, Mephibosheth?\u201d
p8749
sI27
VHe replied, \u201cMy lord the king, my own servant deceived me. Your servant planned to saddle his ass and ride on it and go with Your Majesty\u2014for your servant is lame.

sI28
V[Ziba] has slandered your servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like an angel of the Lord; do as you see fit.
p8751

VFor all the members of my father\u2019s family deserved only death from my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your table. What right have I to appeal further to Your Majesty?\u201d
p8752
sI30
VThe king said to him, \u201cYou need not speak further. I decree that you and Ziba shall divide the property.\u201d

p8758

VYour servant could barely cross the Jordan with your Majesty! Why should Your Majesty reward me so generously?
p8760
sI38
VLet your servant go back, and let me die in my own town, near the graves of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham; let him cross with my lord the king, and do for him as you see fit.\u201d

VAll the troops crossed the Jordan; and when the king was ready to cross, the king kissed Barzillai and bade him farewell; and [Barzillai] returned to his home.

VThe king passed on to Gilgal, with Chimham accompanying him; and all the Judite soldiers and part of the Israelite army escorted the king across.

VThen all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king, \u201cWhy did our kinsmen, the men of Judah, steal you away and escort the king and his family across the Jordan, along with all David\u2019s men?\u201d
p8765
sI43
VAll the men of Judah replied to the men of Israel, \u201cBecause the king is our relative! Why should this upset you? Have we consumed anything that belongs to the king? Has he given us any gifts?\u201d
p8766
sI44
VBut the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, \u201cWe have ten shares in the king, and in David, too, we have more than you. Why then have you slighted us? Were we not the first to propose that our king be brought back?\u201d However, the men of Judah prevailed over the men of Israel.

VAdonijah son of Haggith came to see Bathsheba, Solomon\u2019s mother. She said, \u201cDo you come with friendly intent?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he replied;

Vand he continued, \u201cI would like to have a word with you.\u201d \u201cSpeak up,\u201d she said.
p9007

sI18
V\u201cVery well,\u201d said Bathsheba, \u201cI will speak to the king in your behalf.\u201d
p9011
sI19
VSo Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him about Adonijah. The king rose to greet her and bowed down to her. He sat on his throne; and he had a throne placed for the queen mother, and she sat on his right.
p9012
sI20
VShe said, \u201cI have one small request to make of you, do not refuse me.\u201d He responded, \u201cAsk, Mother; I shall not refuse you.\u201d

sI21
VThen she said, \u201cLet Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as wife.\u201d
p9014
sI22
VThe king replied to his mother, \u201cWhy request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Request the kingship for him! For he is my older brother, and the priest Abiathar and Joab son of Zeruiah are on his side.\u201d
p9015
sI23
VThereupon, King Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, \u201cSo may God do to me and even more, if broaching this matter does not cost Adonijah his life!
p9016
sI24
VNow, as the Lord lives, who has established me and set me on the throne of my father David and who has provided him with a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this very day!\u201d
p9017
sI25
VAnd Solomon instructed Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who struck Adonijah down; and so he died.
p9018
sI26
VTo the priest Abiathar, the king said, \u201cGo to your estate at Anathoth! You deserve to die, but I shall not put you to death at this time, because you carried the Ark of my Lord God before my father David and because you shared all the hardships that my father endured.\u201d
p9019
sI27
VSo Solomon dismissed Abiathar from his office of priest of the Lord\u2014thus fulfilling what the Lord had spoken at Shiloh regarding the house of Eli.
p9020
sI28
VWhen the news reached Joab, he fled to the Tent of the Lord and grasped the horns of the altar\u2014for Joab had sided with Adonijah, though he had not sided with Absalom.
p9021
sI29
VKing Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the Tent of the Lord and that he was there by the altar; so Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, \u201cGo and strike him down.\u201d
p9022
sI30
VBenaiah went to the Tent of the Lord and said to him, \u201cThus said the king: Come out!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d he replied; \u201cI will die here.\u201d Benaiah reported back to the king that Joab had answered thus and thus,
p9023
sI31
Vand the king said, \u201cDo just as he said; strike him down and bury him, and remove guilt from me and my father\u2019s house for the blood of the innocent that Joab has shed.
p9024
sI32
VThus the Lord will bring his blood guilt down upon his own head, because, unbeknown to my father, he struck down with the sword two men more righteous and honorable than he\u2014Abner son of Ner, the army commander of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, the army commander of Judah.
p9025
sI33
VMay the guilt for their blood come down upon the head of Joab and his descendants forever, and may good fortune from the Lord be granted forever to David and his descendants, his house and his throne.\u201d
p9026
sI34
VSo Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down. And he was buried at his home in the wilderness.
p9027
sI35
VIn his place, the king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army, and in place of Abiathar, the king appointed the priest Zadok.

VThen the king summoned Shimei and said to him, \u201cBuild yourself a house in Jerusalem and stay there\u2014do not ever go out from there anywhere else.

VOn the very day that you go out and cross the Wadi Kidron, you can be sure that you will die; your blood shall be on your own head.\u201d

V\u201cThat is fair,\u201d said Shimei to the king, \u201cyour servant will do just as my lord the king has spoken.\u201d And for a long time, Shimei remained in Jerusalem.
p9031

VThree years later, two slaves of Shimei ran away to King Achish son of Maacah of Gath. Shimei was told, \u201cYour slaves are in Gath.\u201d

VShimei thereupon saddled his ass and went to Achish in Gath to claim his slaves; and Shimei returned from Gath with his slaves.
p9033
sI41
VSolomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and back,
p9034

Vand the king summoned Shimei and said to him, \u201cDid I not adjure you by the Lord and warn you, \u2018On the very day that you leave and go anywhere else, you can be sure that you will die,\u2019 and did you not say to me, \u2018It is fair; I accept\u2019?
p9035
sI43
VWhy did you not abide by the oath before the Lord and by the orders which I gave you?\u201d
p9036
sI44
VThe king said further to Shimei, \u201cYou know all the wrong, which you remember very well, that you did to my father David. Now the Lord brings down your wrongdoing upon your own head.
p9037
sI45
VBut King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever.\u201d
p9038

VThe Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this.
p9050
sI11
VAnd God said to him, \u201cBecause you asked for this\u2014you did not ask for long life, you did not ask for riches, you did not ask for the life of your enemies, but you asked for discernment in dispensing justice\u2014
p9051

VLater two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.

VThe first woman said, \u201cPlease, my lord! This woman and I live in the same house; and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house.

VIn the innermost part of the House, he fixed a Shrine in which to place the Ark of the Lord\u2019s Covenant.

VHe built the Lebanon Forest House with four rows of cedar columns, and with hewn cedar beams above the columns. Its length was 100 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits.
p9164

VAnd there were three rows of window frames, with three tiers of windows facing each other.
p9166

VAll the doorways and doorposts had square frames\u2014with three tiers of windows facing each other.

VHe made the portico of columns 50 cubits long and 30 cubits wide; the portico was in front of [the columns], and there were columns with a canopy in front of them.
p9168
sI7
VHe made the throne portico, where he was to pronounce judgment\u2014the Hall of Judgment. It was paneled with cedar from floor to floor.
p9169
sI8
VThe house that he used as a residence, in the rear courtyard, back of the portico, was of the same construction. Solomon also constructed a palace like that portico for the daughter of Pharaoh, whom he had married.
p9170
sI9
VAll these buildings, from foundation to coping and all the way out to the great courtyard, were of choice stones, hewn according to measure, smooth on all sides.
p9171
sI10
VThe foundations were huge blocks of choice stone, stones of 10 cubits and stones of 8 cubits;

sI11
Vand above were choice stones, hewn according to measure, and cedar wood.

VKing Solomon sent for Hiram and brought him down from Tyre.
p9175
sI14
VHe was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father had been a Tyrian, a coppersmith. He was endowed with skill, ability, and talent for executing all work in bronze. He came to King Solomon and executed all his work.
p9176
sI15
VHe cast two columns of bronze; one column was 18 cubits high and measured 12 cubits in circumference, [and similarly] the other column.
p9177
sI16
VHe made two capitals, cast in bronze, to be set upon the two columns, the height of each of the two capitals being 5 cubits;
p9178
sI17
Valso nets of meshwork with festoons of chainwork for the capitals that were on the top of the columns, seven for each of the two capitals.
p9179
sI18
VHe made the columns so that there were two rows [of pomegranates] encircling the top of the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pomegranates; and he did the same for [the network on] the second capital.
p9180
sI19
VThe capitals upon the columns of the portico were of lily design, 4 cubits high;
p9181
sI20
Vso also the capitals upon the two columns extended above and next to the bulge that was beside the network. There were 200 pomegranates in rows around the top of the second capital.
p9182
sI21
VHe set up the columns at the portico of the Great Hall; he set up one column on the right and named it Jachin, and he set up the other column on the left and named it Boaz.
p9183
sI22
VUpon the top of the columns there was a lily design. Thus the work of the columns was completed.
p9184
sI23
VThen he made the tank of cast metal, 10 cubits across from brim to brim, completely round; it was 5 cubits high, and it measured 30 cubits in circumference.
p9185
sI24
VThere were gourds below the brim completely encircling it\u2014ten to a cubit, encircling the tank; the gourds were in two rows, cast in one piece with it.
p9186
sI25
VIt stood upon twelve oxen: three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east, with the tank resting upon them; their haunches were all turned inward.
p9187
sI26
VIt was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like that of a cup, like the petals of a lily. Its capacity was 2,000 baths.
p9188
sI27
VHe made the ten laver stands of bronze. The length of each laver stand was 4 cubits and the width 4 cubits, and the height was 3 cubits.
p9189
sI28
VThe structure of the laver stands was as follows: They had insets, and there were insets within the frames;
p9190
sI29
Vand on the insets within the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. Above the frames was a stand; and both above and below the lions and the oxen were spirals of hammered metal.
p9191
sI30
VEach laver stand had four bronze wheels and [two] bronze axletrees. Its four legs had brackets; the brackets were under the laver, cast with spirals beyond each.
p9192
sI31
VIts funnel, within the crown, rose a cubit above it; this funnel was round, in the fashion of a stand, a cubit and a half in diameter. On the funnel too there were carvings.But the insets were square, not round.
p9193
sI32
VAnd below the insets were the four wheels. The axletrees of the wheels were [fixed] in the laver stand, and the height of each wheel was a cubit and a half.
p9194
sI33
VThe structure of the wheels was like the structure of chariot wheels; and their axletrees, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all of cast metal.
p9195
sI34
VFour brackets ran to the four corners of each laver stand; the brackets were of a piece with the laver stand.
p9196
sI35
VAt the top of the laver stand was a round band half a cubit high, and together with the top of the laver stand; its sides and its insets were of one piece with it.
p9197
sI36
VOn its surface\u2014on its sides\u2014and on its insets [Hiram] engraved cherubim, lions, and palms, as the clear space on each allowed, with spirals roundabout.
p9198
sI37
VIt was after this manner that he made the ten laver stands, all of them cast alike, of the same measure and the same form.
p9199
sI38
VThen he made ten bronze lavers, one laver on each of the ten laver stands, each laver measuring 4 cubits and each laver containing forty baths.
p9200
sI39
VHe disposed the laver stands, five at the right side of the House and five at its left side; and the tank he placed on the right side of the House, at the southeast [corner].
p9201
sI40
VHiram also made the lavers, the scrapers, and the sprinkling bowls.So Hiram finished all the work that he had been doing for King Solomon on the House of the Lord:
p9202
sI41
Vthe two columns, the two globes of the capitals upon the columns; and the two pieces of network to cover the two globes of the capitals upon the columns;
p9203
sI42
Vthe four hundred pomegranates for the two pieces of network, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two globes of the capitals upon the columns;
p9204
sI43
Vthe ten stands and the ten lavers upon the stands;
p9205
sI44
Vthe one tank with the twelve oxen underneath the tank;
p9206
sI45
Vthe pails, the scrapers, and the sprinkling bowls. All those vessels in the House of the Lord that Hiram made for King Solomon were of burnished bronze.
p9207
sI46
VThe king had them cast in earthen molds, in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan.
p9208
sI47
VSolomon left all the vessels [unweighed] because of their very great quantity; the weight of the bronze was not reckoned.
p9209
sI48
VAnd Solomon made all the furnishings that were in the House of the Lord: the altar, of gold; the table for the bread of display, of gold;
p9210
sI49
Vthe lampstands\u2014five on the right side and five on the left\u2014in front of the Shrine, of solid gold; and the petals, lamps, and tongs, of gold;
p9211
sI50
Vthe basins, snuffers, sprinkling bowls, ladles, and fire pans, of solid gold; and the hinge sockets for the doors of the innermost part of the House, the Holy of Holies, and for the doors of the Great Hall of the House, of gold.
p9212
sI51
VWhen all the work that King Solomon had done in the House of the Lord was completed, Solomon brought in the sacred donations of his father David\u2014the silver, the gold, and the vessels\u2014and deposited them in the treasury of the House of the Lord.

VWhen all the elders of Israel had come, the priests lifted the Ark

sI4
Vand carried up the Ark of the Lord. Then the priests and the Levites brought the Tent of Meeting and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent.

sI5
VMeanwhile, King Solomon and the whole community of Israel, who were assembled with him before the Ark, were sacrificing sheep and oxen in such abundance that they could not be numbered or counted.
p9219
sI6
VThe priests brought the Ark of the Lord\u2019s Covenant to its place underneath the wings of the cherubim, in the Shrine of the House, in the Holy of Holies;
p9220
sI7
Vfor the cherubim had their wings spread out over the place of the Ark, so that the cherubim shielded the Ark and its poles from above.

sI8
VThe poles projected so that the ends of the poles were visible in the sanctuary in front of the Shrine, but they could not be seen outside; and there they remain to this day.

VWhen the priests came out of the sanctuary\u2014for the cloud had filled the House of the Lord

p9228
sI15
VHe said:\u201cPraised be the Lord, the God of Israel, who has fulfilled with deeds the promise He made to my father David. For He said,
p9229

V\u2018Ever since I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city among all the tribes of Israel for building a House where My name might abide; but I have chosen David to rule My people Israel.\u2019
p9230
sI17
V\u201cNow my father David had intended to build a House for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
p9231
sI18
VBut the Lord said to my father David, \u2018As regards your intention to build a House for My name, you did right to have that intention.
p9232

VHowever, you shall not build the House yourself; instead, your son, the issue of your loins, shall build the House for My name.\u2019
p9233

Vand I have set a place there for the Ark, containing the covenant which the Lord made with our fathers when He brought them out from the land of Egypt.\u201d

VThat day the king consecrated the center of the court that was in front of the House of the Lord. For it was there that he presented the burnt offerings, the meal offerings, and the fat parts of the offerings of well-being, because the bronze altar that was before the Lord was too small to hold the burnt offerings, the meal offerings, and the fat parts of the offerings of well-being.

VSolomon followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Phoenicians, and Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

VAnother adversary that God raised up against Solomon was Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord, King Hadadezer of Zobah,

sI24
Vwhen David was slaughtering them. He gathered men about him and became captain over a troop; they went to Damascus and settled there, and they established a kingdom in Damascus.

VThe circumstances under which he raised his hand against the king were as follows: Solomon built the Millo and repaired the breach of the city of his father, David.
p9367
sI28
VThis Jeroboam was an able man, and when Solomon saw that the young man was a capable worker, he appointed him over all the forced labor of the House of Joseph.

V\u201cTake ten pieces,\u201d he said to Jeroboam. \u201cFor thus said the Lord, the God of Israel: I am about to tear the kingdom out of Solomon\u2019s hands, and I will give you ten tribes.

sI32
VBut one tribe shall remain his\u2014for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.
p9372
sI33
VFor they have forsaken Me; they have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Phoenicians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites; they have not walked in My ways, or done what is pleasing to Me, or [kept] My laws and rules, as his father David did.
p9373
sI34
VHowever, I will not take the entire kingdom away from him, but will keep him as ruler as long as he lives for the sake of My servant David whom I chose, and who kept My commandments and My laws.
p9374
sI35
VBut I will take the kingship out of the hands of his son and give it to you\u2014the ten tribes.

VThey sent for him; and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam as follows:
p9387

V\u201cYour father made our yoke heavy. Now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke which your father laid on us, and we will serve you.\u201d

p9390

VThey answered him, \u201cIf you will be a servant to those people today and serve them, and if you respond to them with kind words, they will be your servants always.\u201d

V\u201cWhat,\u201d he asked, \u201cdo you advise that we reply to the people who said to me, \u2018Lighten the yoke that your father placed upon us\u2019?\u201d
p9393
sI10
VAnd the young men who had grown up with him answered, \u201cSpeak thus to the people who said to you, \u2018Your father made our yoke heavy, now you make it lighter for us.\u2019 Say to them, \u2018My little finger is thicker than my father\u2019s loins.

VJeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, since the king had told them: \u201cCome back on the third day.\u201d
p9396
sI13
VThe king answered the people harshly, ignoring the advice that the elders had given him.
p9397
sI14
VHe spoke to them in accordance with the advice of the young men, and said, \u201cMy father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father flogged you with whips, but I will flog you with scorpions.\u201d

V(The king did not listen to the people; for the Lord had brought it about in order to fulfill the promise that the Lord had made through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.)
p9399
sI16
VWhen all Israel saw that the king had not listened to them, the people answered the king:\u201cWe have no portion in David,No share in Jesse\u2019s son!To your tents, O Israel!Now look to your own House, O David.\u201dSo the Israelites returned to their homes.

VBut Rehoboam continued to reign over the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah.
p9401
sI18
VKing Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, but all Israel pelted him to death with stones. Thereupon King Rehoboam hurriedly mounted his chariot and fled to Jerusalem.
p9402
sI19
VThus Israel revolted against the House of David, as is still the case.
p9403
sI20
VWhen all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent messengers and summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the House of David.

sI21
VOn his return to Jerusalem, Rehoboam mustered all the House of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 picked warriors, to fight against the House of Israel, in order to restore the kingship to Rehoboam son of Solomon.

VJeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and resided there; he moved out from there and fortified Penuel.

VSo the king took counsel and made two golden calves. He said to the people, \u201cYou have been going up to Jerusalem long enough. This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!\u201d
p9412
sI29
VHe set up one in Bethel and placed the other in Dan.
p9413

VHe also made cult places and appointed priests from the ranks of the people who were not of Levite descent.

VHe gave a portent on that day, saying, \u201cHere is the portent that the Lord has decreed: This altar shall break apart, and the ashes on it shall be spilled.\u201d
p9421
sI4
VWhen the king heard what the man of God had proclaimed against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his arm above the altar and cried, \u201cSeize him!\u201d But the arm that he stretched out against him became rigid, and he could not draw it back.
p9422
sI5
VThe altar broke apart and its ashes were spilled\u2014the very portent that the man of God had announced at the Lord\u2019s command.

VThen the king spoke up and said to the man of God, \u201cPlease entreat the Lord your God and pray for me that I may be able to draw back my arm.\u201d The man of God entreated the Lord and the king was able to draw his arm back; it became as it was before.
p9424
sI7
VThe king said to the man of God, \u201cCome with me to my house and have some refreshment; and I shall give you a gift.\u201d
p9425

VBut the man of God replied to the king, \u201cEven if you give me half your wealth, I will not go in with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water in this place;

Vfor so I was commanded by the word of the Lord: You shall eat no bread and drink no water, nor shall you go back by the road by which you came.\u201d

VThere was an old prophet living in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the things that the man of God had done that day in Bethel [and] the words that he had spoken to the king. When they told it to their father,

VAnd when the prophet who had brought him back from the road heard it, he said, \u201cThat is the man of God who flouted the Lord\u2019s command; the Lord gave him over to the lion, which mauled him and killed him in accordance with the word that the Lord had spoken to him.\u201d
p9444

VHe set out and found the corpse lying on the road, with the ass and the lion standing beside the corpse; the lion had not eaten the corpse nor had it mauled the ass.

VThe prophet lifted up the corpse of the man of God, laid it on the ass, and brought it back; it was brought to the town of the old prophet for lamentation and burial.

VAnd the king of Aram said, \u201cGo to the king of Israel, and I will send along a letter.\u201dHe set out, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten changes of clothing.
p9904

VHe brought the letter to the king of Israel. It read: \u201cNow, when this letter reaches you, know that I have sent my courtier Naaman to you, that you may cure him of his leprosy.\u201d
p9905
sI7
VWhen the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and cried, \u201cAm I God, to deal death or give life, that this fellow writes to me to cure a man of leprosy? Just see for yourselves that he is seeking a pretext against me!\u201d
p9906
sI8
VWhen Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, he sent a message to the king: \u201cWhy have you rent your clothes? Let him come to me, and he will learn that there is a prophet in Israel.\u201d

VBut Naaman was angered and walked away. \u201cI thought,\u201d he said, \u201che would surely come out to me, and would stand and invoke the Lord his God by name, and would wave his hand toward the spot, and cure the affected part.
p9910
sI12
VAre not the Amanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? I could bathe in them and be clean!\u201d And he stalked off in a rage.
p9911
sI13
VBut his servants came forward and spoke to him. \u201cSir,\u201d they said, \u201cif the prophet told you to do something difficult, would you not do it? How much more when he has only said to you, \u2018Bathe and be clean.\u2019\ufeff\u201d

VReturning with his entire retinue to the man of God, he stood before him and exclaimed, \u201cNow I know that there is no God in the whole world except in Israel! So please accept a gift from your servant.\u201d

VBut he replied, \u201cAs the Lord lives, whom I serve, I will not accept anything.\u201d He pressed him to accept, but he refused.

VBut may the Lord pardon your servant for this: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to bow low in worship there, and he is leaning on my arm so that I must bow low in the temple of Rimmon\u2014when I bow low in the temple of Rimmon, may the Lord pardon your servant in this.\u201d

VSo Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he alighted from his chariot to meet him and said, \u201cIs all well?\u201d
p9920
sI22
V\u201cAll is well,\u201d he replied. \u201cMy master has sent me to say: Two youths, disciples of the prophets, have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.\u201d
p9921
sI23
VNaaman said, \u201cPlease take two talents.\u201d He urged him, and he wrapped the two talents of silver in two bags and gave them, along with two changes of clothes, to two of his servants, who carried them ahead of him.

p9924
sI26
VThen [Elisha] said to him, \u201cDid not my spirit go along when a man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this a time to take money in order to buy clothing and olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves?

VBut the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, \u201cTake care not to pass through that place, for the Arameans are encamped there.\u201d
p9936
sI10
VSo the king of Israel sent word to the place of which the man of God had told him. Time and again he alerted such a place and took precautions there.
p9937
sI11
VGreatly agitated about this matter, the king of Aram summoned his officers and said to them, \u201cTell me! Who of us is on the side of the king of Israel?\u201d
p9938
sI12
V\u201cNo one, my lord king,\u201d said one of the officers. \u201cElisha, that prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.\u201d

sI16
V\u201cHave no fear,\u201d he replied. \u201cThere are more on our side than on theirs.\u201d
p9943

VThen Elisha prayed: \u201cLord, open his eyes and let him see.\u201d And the Lord opened the servant\u2019s eyes and he saw the hills all around Elisha covered with horses and chariots of fire.
p9944
sI18
V[The Arameans] came down against him, and Elisha prayed to the Lord: \u201cPlease strike this people with a blinding light.\u201d And He struck them with a blinding light, as Elisha had asked.
p9945
sI19
VElisha said to them, \u201cThis is not the road, and that is not the town; follow me, and I will lead you to the man you want.\u201d And he led them to Samaria.
p9946
sI20
VWhen they entered Samaria, Elisha said, \u201cO Lord, open the eyes of these men so that they may see.\u201d The Lord opened their eyes and they saw that they were inside Samaria.
p9947
sI21
VWhen the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, \u201cFather, shall I strike them down?\u201d
p9948
sI22
V\u201cNo, do not,\u201d he replied. \u201cDid you take them captive with your sword and bow that you would strike them down? Rather, set food and drink before them, and let them eat and drink and return to their master.\u201d
p9949
sI23
VSo he prepared a lavish feast for them and, after they had eaten and drunk, he let them go, and they returned to their master. And the Aramean bands stopped invading the land of Israel.

VSometime later, King Ben-hadad of Aram mustered his entire army and marched upon Samaria and besieged it.
p9951

p9954
sI28
VBut what troubles you?\u201d the king asked her. The woman answered, \u201cThat woman said to me, \u2018Give up your son and we will eat him today; and tomorrow we\u2019ll eat my son.\u2019
p9955
sI29
VSo we cooked my son and we ate him. The next day I said to her, \u2018Give up your son and let\u2019s eat him\u2019; but she hid her son.\u201d

VIf we decide to go into the town, what with the famine in the town, we shall die there; and if we just sit here, still we die. Come, let us desert to the Aramean camp. If they let us live, we shall live; and if they put us to death, we shall but die.\u201d

sI5
VThey set out at twilight for the Aramean camp; but when they came to the edge of the Aramean camp, there was no one there.
p9966

VFor the Lord had caused the Aramean camp to hear a sound of chariots, a sound of horses\u2014the din of a huge army. They said to one another, \u201cThe king of Israel must have hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Mizraim to attack us!\u201d

VWhen those lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into one of the tents and ate and drank; then they carried off silver and gold and clothing from there and buried it. They came back and went into another tent, and they carried off what was there and buried it.
p9969

VThen they said to one another, \u201cWe are not doing right. This is a day of good news, and we are keeping silent! If we wait until the light of morning, we shall incur guilt. Come, let us go and inform the king\u2019s palace.\u201d

VThey went and called out to the gatekeepers of the city and told them, \u201cWe have been to the Aramean camp. There is not a soul there, nor any human sound; but the horses are tethered and the asses are tethered and the tents are undisturbed.\u201d

VThe king rose in the night and said to his courtiers, \u201cI will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are starving, so they have gone out of camp and hidden in the fields, thinking: When they come out of the town, we will take them alive and get into the town.\u201d
p9973
sI13
VBut one of the courtiers spoke up, \u201cLet a few of the remaining horses that are still here be taken\u2014they are like those that are left here of the whole multitude of Israel, out of the whole multitude of Israel that have perished\u2014and let us send and find out.\u201d

VPerhaps the Lord your God will take note of all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to blaspheme the living God, and will mete out judgment for the words that the Lord your God has heard\u2014if you will offer up prayer for the surviving remnant.\u201d

VHezekiah said, \u201cIt is easy for the shadow to lengthen ten steps, but not for the shadow to recede ten steps.\u201d

VAt that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and the prophet Jeremiah was confined in the prison compound attached to the palace of the king of Judah.
p12706
sI3
VFor King Zedekiah of Judah had confined him, saying, \u201cHow dare you prophesy: \u2018Thus said the Lord: I am delivering this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall capture it.
p12707

p12710
sI7
VHanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, will come to you and say, \u201cBuy my land in Anathoth, for you are next in succession to redeem it by purchase.\u201d
p12711
sI8
VAnd just as the Lord had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the prison compound and said to me, \u201cPlease buy my land in Anathoth, in the territory of Benjamin; for the right of succession is yours, and you have the duty of redemption. Buy it.\u201d Then I knew that it was indeed the word of the Lord.
p12712

VSo I bought the land in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel. I weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver.
p12713
sI10
VI wrote a deed, sealed it, and had it witnessed; and I weighed out the silver on a balance.
p12714
sI11
VI took the deed of purchase, the sealed text and the open one according to rule and law,
p12715
sI12
Vand gave the deed to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah in the presence of my kinsman Hanamel, of the witnesses who were named in the deed, and all the Judeans who were sitting in the prison compound.
p12716
sI13
VIn their presence I charged Baruch as follows:
p12717
sI14
VThus said the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: \u201cTake these documents, this deed of purchase, the sealed text and the open one, and put them into an earthen jar, so that they may last a long time.\u201d

VFor thus said the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: \u201cHouses, fields, and vineyards shall again be purchased in this land.\u201d

VBut after I had given the deed to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the Lord:

V\u201cAh, Lord God! You made heaven and earth with Your great might and outstretched arm. Nothing is too wondrous for You!

sI18
VYou show kindness to the thousandth generation, but visit the guilt of the fathers upon their children after them. O great and mighty God whose name is Lord of Hosts,

VYet You, Lord God, said to me: Buy the land for money and call in witnesses\u2014when the city is at the mercy of the Chaldeans!\u201d

VAnd the Chaldeans who have been attacking this city shall come and set this city on fire and burn it down\u2014with the houses on whose roofs they made offerings to Baal and poured out libations to other gods, so as to vex Me.

VThis city has aroused My anger and My wrath from the day it was built until this day; so that it must be removed from My sight

Vand they built the shrines of Baal which are in the Valley of Ben-hinnom, where they offered up their sons and daughters to Molech\u2014when I had never commanded, or even thought [of commanding], that they should do such an abominable thing, and so bring guilt on Judah.

VAnd I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them and that I will treat them graciously; and I will put into their hearts reverence for Me, so that they do not turn away from Me.
p12744
sI41
VI will delight in treating them graciously, and I will plant them in this land faithfully, with all My heart and soul.
p12745

VFor thus said the Lord: As I have brought this terrible disaster upon this people, so I am going to bring upon them the vast good fortune which I have promised for them.

VAnd fields shall again be purchased in this land of which you say, \u201cIt is a desolation, without man or beast; it is delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans.\u201d

p13311
sI5
VIn the center of it were also the figures of four creatures. And this was their appearance:They had the figures of human beings.
p13312
sI6
VHowever, each had four faces, and each of them had four wings;
p13313
sI7
Vthe legs of each were [fused into] a single rigid leg, and the feet of each were like a single calf\u2019s hoof; and their sparkle was like the luster of burnished bronze.

sI8
VThey had human hands below their wings. The four of them had their faces and their wings on their four sides.

sI9
VEach one\u2019s wings touched those of the other. They did not turn when they moved; each could move in the direction of any of its faces.
p13316

VEach of them had a human face  the front]; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right; each of the four had the face of an ox on the left; and each of the four had the face of an eagle  the back].
p13317
sI11
VSuch were their faces. As for their wings, they were separated: above, each had two touching those of the others, while the other two covered its body.
p13318
sI12
VAnd each could move in the direction of any of its faces; they went wherever the spirit impelled them to go, without turning when they moved.
p13319
sI13
VSuch then was the appearance of the creatures. With them was something that looked like burning coals of fire. This fire, suggestive of torches, kept moving about among the creatures; the fire had a radiance, and lightning issued from the fire.

VDashing to and fro [among] the creatures was something that looked like flares.
p13321
sI15
VAs I gazed on the creatures, I saw one wheel on the ground next to each of the four-faced creatures.
p13322
sI16
VAs for the appearance and structure of the wheels, they gleamed like beryl. All four had the same form; the appearance and structure of each was as of two wheels cutting through each other.
p13323
sI17
VAnd when they moved, each could move in the direction of any of its four quarters; they did not veer when they moved.
p13324
sI18
VTheir rims were tall and frightening, for the rims of all four were covered all over with eyes.
p13325

VAnd when the creatures moved forward, the wheels moved at their sides; and when the creatures were borne above the earth, the wheels were borne too.
p13326

VWherever the spirit impelled them to go, they went\u2014wherever the spirit impelled them\u2014and the wheels were borne alongside them; for the spirit of the creatures was in the wheels.
p13327

VAbove the heads of the creatures was a form: an expanse, with an awe-inspiring gleam as of crystal, was spread out above their heads.

sI23
VUnder the expanse, each had one pair of wings extended toward those of the others; and each had another pair covering its body.
p13330
sI24
VWhen they moved, I could hear the sound of their wings like the sound of mighty waters, like the sound of Shaddai, a tumult like the din of an army. When they stood still, they would let their wings droop.
p13331
sI25
VFrom above the expanse over their heads came a sound. When they stood still, they would let their wings droop.

VAnd He said to me, \u201cEnter and see the vile abominations that they are practicing here.\u201d

VI entered and looked, and there all detestable forms of creeping things and beasts and all the fetishes of the House of Israel were depicted over the entire wall.
p13464

VBefore them stood seventy men, elders of the House of Israel, with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing in their midst. Everyone had a censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense smoke ascended.
p13465
sI12
VAgain He spoke to me, \u201cO mortal, have you seen what the elders of the House of Israel are doing in the darkness, everyone in his image-covered chamber? For they say, \u2018The Lord does not see us; the Lord has abandoned the country.\u2019\ufeff\u201d
p13466
sI13
VAnd He said to me, \u201cYou shall see even more terrible abominations which they practice.\u201d
p13467
sI14
VNext He brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the House of the Lord; and there sat the women bewailing Tammuz.
p13468
sI15
VHe said to me, \u201cHave you seen, O mortal? You shall see even more terrible abominations than these.\u201d
p13469
sI16
VThen He brought me into the inner court of the House of the Lord, and there, at the entrance to the Temple of the Lord, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men, their backs to the Temple of the Lord and their faces to the east; they were bowing low to the sun in the east.
p13470
sI17
VAnd He said to me, \u201cDo you see, O mortal? Is it not enough for the House of Judah to practice the abominations that they have committed here, that they must fill the country with lawlessness and provoke Me still further and thrust the branch to their nostrils?

VAnd six men entered by way of the upper gate that faces north, each with his club in his hand; and among them was another, clothed in linen, with a writing case at his waist. They came forward and stopped at the bronze altar.
p13475
sI3
VNow the Presence of the God of Israel had moved from the cherub on which it had rested to the platform of the House. He called to the man clothed in linen with the writing case at his waist;
p13476
sI4
Vand the Lord said to him, \u201cPass through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who moan and groan because of all the abominations that are committed in it.\u201d

sI5
VTo the others He said in my hearing, \u201cFollow him through the city and strike; show no pity or compassion.
p13478
sI6
VKill off graybeard, youth and maiden, women and children; but do not touch any person who bears the mark. Begin here at My Sanctuary.\u201d So they began with the elders who were in front of the House.
p13479
sI7
VAnd He said to them, \u201cDefile the House and fill the courts with the slain. Then go forth.\u201d So they went forth and began to kill in the city.
p13480
sI8
VWhen they were out killing, and I remained alone, I flung myself on my face and cried out, \u201cAh, Lord God! Are you going to annihilate all that is left of Israel, pouring out Your fury upon Jerusalem?\u201d
p13481
sI9
VHe answered me, \u201cThe iniquity of the Houses of Judah and Israel is very very great, the land is full of crime and the city is full of corruption. For they say, \u2018The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see.\u2019

VI, in turn, will show no pity or compassion; I will give them their deserts.\u201d

sI2
VHe spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, \u201cStep inside the wheelwork, under the cherubs, and fill your hands with glowing coals from among the cherubs, and scatter them over the city.\u201d And he went in as I looked on.
p13487
sI3
VNow the cherubs were standing on the south side of the House when the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner court.
p13488
sI4
VBut when the Presence of the Lord moved from the cherubs to the platform of the House, the House was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the radiance of the Presence of the Lord.
p13489
sI5
VThe sound of the cherubs\u2019 wings could be heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of El Shaddai when He speaks.
p13490
sI6
VWhen He commanded the man dressed in linen: \u201cTake fire from among the cherubs within the wheelwork,\u201d he went in and stood beside a wheel.
p13491

VAnd a cherub stretched out his hand among the cherubs to the fire that was among the cherubs; he took some and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
p13492
sI8
VThe cherubs appeared to have the form of a man\u2019s hand under their wings.
p13493

VI could see that there were four wheels beside the cherubs, one wheel beside each of the cherubs; as for the appearance of the wheels, they gleamed like the beryl stone.
p13494
sI10
VIn appearance, the four had the same form, as if there were two wheels cutting through each other.
p13495
sI11
VAnd when they moved, each could move in the direction of any of its four quarters; they did not veer as they moved. The [cherubs] moved in the direction in which one of the heads faced, without turning as they moved.
p13496
sI12
VTheir entire bodies\u2014backs, hands, and wings\u2014and the wheels, the wheels of the four of them, were covered all over with eyes.
p13497
sI13
VIt was these wheels that I had heard called \u201cthe wheelwork.\u201d
p13498
sI14
VEach one had four faces: One was a cherub\u2019s face, the second a human face, the third a lion\u2019s face, and the fourth an eagle\u2019s face.
p13499
sI15
VThe cherubs ascended; those were the creatures that I had seen by the Chebar Canal.
p13500
sI16
VWhenever the cherubs went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubs lifted their wings to ascend from the earth, the wheels did not roll away from their side.
p13501
sI17
VWhen those stood still, these stood still; and when those ascended, these ascended with them, for the spirit of the creature was in them.
p13502
sI18
VThen the Presence of the Lord left the platform of the House and stopped above the cherubs.
p13503
sI19
VAnd I saw the cherubs lift their wings and rise from the earth, with the wheels beside them as they departed; and they stopped at the entrance of the eastern gate of the House of the Lord, with the Presence of the God of Israel above them.
p13504
sI20
VThey were the same creatures that I had seen below the God of Israel at the Chebar Canal; so now I knew that they were cherubs.

VEach one had four faces and each had four wings, with the form of human hands under the wings.

VAs for your birth, when you were born your navel cord was not cut, and you were not bathed in water to smooth you; you were not rubbed with salt, nor were you swaddled.

VNo one pitied you enough to do any one of these things for you out of compassion for you; on the day you were born, you were left lying, rejected, in the open field.
p13625

VWhen I passed by you and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you: \u201cLive in spite of your blood.\u201d Yea, I said to you: \u201cLive in spite of your blood.\u201d

sI8
Vwhen I passed by you [again] and saw that your time for love had arrived. So I spread My robe over you and covered your nakedness, and I entered into a covenant with you by oath\u2014declares the Lord God; thus you became Mine.
p13628
sI9
VI bathed you in water, and washed the blood off you, and anointed you with oil.
p13629

VI clothed you with embroidered garments, and gave you sandals of tahash-leather to wear, and wound fine linen about your head, and dressed you in silks.
p13630
sI11
VI decked you out in finery and put bracelets on your arms and a chain around your neck.
p13631

VI put a ring in your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a splendid crown on your head.
p13632

VYou adorned yourself with gold and silver, and your apparel was of fine linen, silk, and embroidery. Your food was choice flour, honey, and oil. You grew more and more beautiful, and became fit for royalty.
p13633
sI14
VYour beauty won you fame among the nations, for it was perfected through the splendor which I set upon you\u2014declares the Lord God.
p13634
sI15
VBut confident in your beauty and fame, you played the harlot: you lavished your favors on every passerby; they were his.
p13635
sI16
VYou even took some of your cloths and made yourself tapestried platforms and fornicated on them\u2014not in the future; not in time to come.
p13636
sI17
VYou took your beautiful things, made of the gold and silver that I had given you, and you made yourself phallic images and fornicated with them.

VThe food that I had given you\u2014the choice flour, the oil, and the honey, which I had provided for you to eat\u2014you set it before them for a pleasing odor. And so it went\u2014declares the Lord God.

VYou even took the sons and daughters that you bore to Me and sacrificed them to those [images] as food\u2014as if your harlotries were not enough,
p13640
sI21
Vyou slaughtered My children and presented them as offerings to them!

VNow, I will stretch out My arm against you and withhold your maintenance; and I will surrender you to the will of your enemies, the Philistine women, who are shocked by your lewd behavior.
p13647

VIn your insatiable lust you also played the whore with the Assyrians; you played the whore with them, but were still unsated.
p13648

VYou multiplied your harlotries with Chaldea, that land of traders; yet even with this you were not satisfied.
p13649

VHow sick was your heart\u2014declares the Lord God\u2014when you did all those things, the acts of a self-willed whore,
p13650
sI31
Vbuilding your eminence at every crossroad and setting your mound in every square! Yet you were not like a prostitute, for you spurned fees;
p13651
sI32
V[you were like] the adulterous wife who welcomes strangers instead of her husband.
p13652
sI33
VGifts are made to all prostitutes, but you made gifts to all your lovers, and bribed them to come to you from every quarter for your harlotries.
p13653
sI34
VYou were the opposite of other women: you solicited instead of being solicited; you paid fees instead of being paid fees. Thus you were just the opposite!
p13654
sI35
VNow, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord.
p13655
sI36
VThus said the Lord God: Because of your brazen effrontery, offering your nakedness to your lovers for harlotry\u2014just like the blood of your children, which you gave to all your abominable fetishes:\u2014
p13656
sI37
VI will assuredly assemble all the lovers to whom you gave your favors, along with everybody you accepted and everybody you rejected. I will assemble them against you from every quarter, and I will expose your nakedness to them, and they shall see all your nakedness.
p13657
sI38
VI will inflict upon you the punishment of women who commit adultery and murder, and I will direct bloody and impassioned fury against you.
p13658
sI39
VI will deliver you into their hands, and they shall tear down your eminence and level your mounds; and they shall strip you of your clothing and take away your dazzling jewels, leaving you naked and bare.
p13659
sI40
VThen they shall assemble a mob against you to pelt you with stones and pierce you with their swords.
p13660
sI41
VThey shall put your houses to the flames and execute punishment upon you in the sight of many women; thus I will put a stop to your harlotry, and you shall pay no more fees.
p13661

VWhen I have satisfied My fury upon you and My rage has departed from you, then I will be tranquil; I will be angry no more.

sI43
VBecause you did not remember the days of your youth, but infuriated Me with all those things, I will pay you back for your conduct\u2014declares the Lord God.Have you not committed depravity on top of all your other abominations?
p13663
sI44
VWhy, everyone who uses proverbs applies to you the proverb \u201cLike mother, like daughter.\u201d
p13664
sI45
VYou are the daughter of your mother, who rejected her husband and children. And you are the sister of your sisters, who rejected their husbands and children; for you are daughters of a Hittite mother and an Amorite father.
p13665
sI46
VYour elder sister was Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you; your younger sister was Sodom, who lived with her daughters to the south of you.
p13666
sI47
VDid you not walk in their ways and practice their abominations? Why, you were almost more corrupt than they in all your ways.
p13667
sI48
VAs I live\u2014declares the Lord God\u2014your sister Sodom and her daughters did not do what you and your daughters did.
p13668
sI49
VOnly this was the sin of your sister Sodom: arrogance! She and her daughters had plenty of bread and untroubled tranquillity; yet she did not support the poor and the needy.
p13669
sI50
VIn their haughtiness, they committed abomination before Me; and so I removed them, as you saw.
p13670
sI51
VNor did Samaria commit even half your sins. You committed more abominations than they, and by all the abominations that you committed you made your sisters look righteous.
p13671
sI52
VTruly, you must bear the disgrace of serving as your sisters\u2019 advocate: Since you have sinned more abominably than they, they appear righteous in comparison. So be ashamed and bear your disgrace, because you have made your sisters look righteous.
p13672
sI53
VI will restore their fortunes\u2014the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters\u2014and your fortunes along with theirs.
p13673
sI54
VThus you shall bear your disgrace and feel your disgrace for behaving in such a way that they could take comfort.
p13674
sI55
VThen your sister Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, and you and your daughters shall return to your former state.
p13675
sI56
VWas not your sister Sodom a byword in your mouth in the days of your pride,
p13676
sI57
Vbefore your own wickedness was exposed? So must you now bear the mockery of the daughters of Aram and all her neighbors, the daughters of Philistia who jeer at you on every side.
p13677
sI58
VYou yourself must bear your depravity and your abominations\u2014declares the Lord.
p13678
sI59
VTruly, thus said the Lord God: I will deal with you as you have dealt, for you have spurned the pact and violated the covenant.
p13679
sI60
VNevertheless, I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish it with you as an everlasting covenant.
p13680
sI61
VYou shall remember your ways and feel ashamed, when you receive your older sisters and your younger sisters, and I give them to you as daughters, though they are not of your covenant.
p13681
sI62
VI will establish My covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the Lord.

VSay: Thus said the Lord God: The great eagle with the great wings and the long pinions, with the full plumage and the brilliant colors, came to the Lebanon range and seized the top of the cedar.
p13687
sI4
VHe plucked off its topmost bough and carried it off to the land of traders and set it in a city of merchants.
p13688
sI5
VHe then took some of the seed of the land and planted it in a fertile field;  he planted and set it like a willow beside abundant waters.
p13689
sI6
VIt grew and became a spreading vine of low stature; it became a vine, produced branches, and sent out boughs. [He had intended] that its twigs should turn to him, and that its roots should stay under him.
p13690
sI7
VBut there was another great eagle with great wings and full plumage; and this vine now bent its roots in his direction and sent out its twigs toward him, that he might water it more than the bed where it was planted\u2014
p13691
sI8
Vthough it was planted in rich soil beside abundant water\u2014so that it might grow branches and produce boughs and be a noble vine.
p13692
sI9
VSay: Thus said the Lord God: Will it thrive? Will he not tear out its roots and rip off its crown, so that its entire foliage withers? It shall wither, despite any strong arm or mighty army [that may come] to remove it from its roots.
p13693
sI10
VAnd suppose it is transplanted, will it thrive? When the east wind strikes it, it shall wither\u2014wither upon the bed where it is growing.
p13694
sI11
VThen the word of the Lord came to me:
p13695
sI12
VSay to the rebellious breed: Do you not know what these things mean? Say: The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and carried away its king and its officers and brought them back with him to Babylon.
p13696

VHe took one of the seed royal and made a covenant with him and imposed an oath on him, and he carried away the nobles of the land\u2014

Vso that it might be a humble kingdom and not exalt itself, but keep his covenant and so endure.

sI23
VI will plant it in Israel\u2019s lofty highlands, and it shall bring forth boughs and produce branches and grow into a noble cedar. Every bird of every feather shall take shelter under it, shelter in the shade of its boughs.

VConsider, all lives are Mine; the life of the parent and the life of the child are both Mine. The person who sins, only he shall die.
p13713

VThus, if a man is righteous and does what is just and right:
p13714

VIf he has not eaten on the mountains or raised his eyes to the fetishes of the House of Israel; if he has not defiled another man\u2019s wife or approached a menstruous woman;
p13715
sI7
Vif he has not wronged anyone; if he has returned the debtor\u2019s pledge to him and has taken nothing by robbery; if he has given bread to the hungry and clothed the naked;

VThe person who sins, he alone shall die. A child shall not share the burden of a parent\u2019s guilt, nor shall a parent share the burden of a child\u2019s guilt; the righteousness of the righteous shall be accounted to him alone, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be accounted to him alone.

VSo, too, if a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does wrong, practicing the very abominations that the wicked person practiced, shall he live? None of the righteous deeds that he did shall be remembered; because of the treachery he has practiced and the sins he has committed\u2014because of these, he shall die.

VMoreover, I gave them laws that were not good and rules by which they could not live:

VNow, O mortal, speak to the House of Israel and say to them: Thus said the Lord God: By this too your fathers affronted Me and committed trespass against Me:

VWhen I brought them to the land that I had sworn to give them, and they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, they slaughtered their sacrifices there and presented their offensive offerings there; there they produced their pleasing odors and poured out their libations.

VFor only on My holy mountain, on the lofty mount of Israel\u2014declares the Lord God\u2014there, in the land, the entire House of Israel, all of it, must worship Me. There I will accept them, and there I will take note of your contributions and the choicest offerings of all your sacred things.

VTheir names were: the elder one, Oholah; and her sister, Oholibah. They became Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
p13876
sI5
VOholah whored while she was Mine, and she lusted after her lovers, after the Assyrians, warriors
p13877

Vclothed in blue, governors and prefects, horsemen mounted on steeds\u2014all of them handsome young fellows.
p13878
sI7
VShe bestowed her favors upon them\u2014upon all the pick of the Assyrians\u2014and defiled herself with all their fetishes after which she lusted.
p13879
sI8
VShe did not give up the whoring she had begun with the Egyptians; for they had lain with her in her youth, and they had handled her virgin nipples and had poured out their lust upon her.
p13880
sI9
VTherefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians after whom she lusted.
p13881
sI10
VThey exposed her nakedness; they seized her sons and daughters, and she herself was put to the sword. And because of the punishment inflicted upon her, she became a byword among women.
p13882

VHer sister Oholibah saw this; yet her lusting was more depraved than her sister\u2019s, and her whoring more debased.
p13883
sI12
VShe lusted after the Assyrians, governors and prefects, warriors gorgeously clad, horsemen mounted on steeds\u2014all of them handsome young fellows.
p13884
sI13
VAnd I saw how she had defiled herself. Both of them followed the same course,
p13885

Vbut she carried her harlotries further. For she saw men sculptured upon the walls, figures of Chaldeans drawn in vermilion,
p13886

Vgirded with belts round their waists, and with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers\u2014a picture of Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea.
p13887

VAt the very sight of them she lusted after them, and she sent messengers for them to Chaldea.
p13888

VSo the Babylonians came to her for lovemaking and defiled her with their whoring; and she defiled herself with them until she turned from them in disgust.
p13889

VShe flaunted her harlotries and exposed her nakedness, and I turned from her in disgust, as I had turned disgusted from her sister.
p13890

VBut she whored still more, remembering how in her youth she had played the whore in the land of Egypt;
p13891

Vshe lusted for concubinage with them, whose members were like those of asses and whose organs were like those of stallions.

VHere its upper chambers were cut back, because ledges took away from them as construction proceeded backward from the bottom ones and then from the middle ones.

sI6
VFor they were arranged in three tiers, and they had no columns like those of the chambers in the courts. That is why the rise proceeded by stages: from the ground, from the bottom ones, and from the middle ones.

p20237
sI13
VWhy do you complain against HimThat He does not reply to any of man\u2019s charges?

sI11
VAnd now, daughter, have no fear. I will do in your behalf whatever you ask, for all the elders of my town know what a fine woman you are.

VI thought I should disclose the matter to you and say: Acquire it in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you are willing to redeem it, redeem! But if you will not redeem, tell me, that I may know. For there is no one to redeem but you, and I come after you.\u201d \u201cI am willing to redeem it,\u201d he replied.

VThe redeemer replied, \u201cThen I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own estate. You take over my right of redemption, for I am unable to exercise it.\u201d
p20727
sI7
VNow this was formerly done in Israel in cases of redemption or exchange: to validate any transaction, one man would take off his sandal and hand it to the other. Such was the practice in Israel.

VI am also acquiring Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, as my wife, so as to perpetuate the name of the deceased upon his estate, that the name of the deceased may not disappear from among his kinsmen and from the gate of his home town. You are witnesses today.\u201d

VAll the people at the gate and the elders answered, \u201cWe are. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built up the House of Israel! Prosper in Ephrathah and perpetuate your name in Bethlehem!

p20930

VI ventured to tempt my flesh with wine, and to grasp folly, while letting my mind direct with wisdom, to the end that I might learn which of the two was better for men to practice in their few days of life under heaven.
p20931
sI4
VI multiplied my possessions. I built myself houses and I planted vineyards.
p20932
sI5
VI laid out gardens and groves, in which I planted every kind of fruit tree.
p20933
sI6
VI constructed pools of water, enough to irrigate a forest shooting up with trees.
p20934
sI7
VI bought male and female slaves, and I acquired stewards. I also acquired more cattle, both herds and flocks, than all who were before me in Jerusalem.
p20935

VI further amassed silver and gold and treasures of kings and provinces; and I got myself male and female singers, as well as the luxuries of commoners\u2014coffers and coffers of them.
p20936
sI9
VThus, I gained more wealth than anyone before me in Jerusalem. In addition, my wisdom remained with me:
p20937
sI10
VI withheld from my eyes nothing they asked for, and denied myself no enjoyment; rather, I got enjoyment out of all my wealth. And that was all I got out of my wealth.
p20938
sI11
VThen my thoughts turned to all the fortune my hands had built up, to the wealth I had acquired and won\u2014and oh, it was all futile and pursuit of wind; there was no real value under the sun!
p20939
sI12
VFor what will the man be like who will succeed the one who is ruling over what was built up long ago?My thoughts also turned to appraising wisdom and madness and folly.

VI found thatWisdom is superior to follyAs light is superior to darkness;
p20941
sI14
VA wise man has his eyes in his head,Whereas a fool walks in darkness.But I also realized that the same fate awaits them both.
p20942

Vbecause the wise man, just like the fool, is not remembered forever; for, as the succeeding days roll by, both are forgotten. Alas, the wise man dies, just like the fool!
p20944

VAnd so I loathed life. For I was distressed by all that goes on under the sun, because everything is futile and pursuit of wind.

VTo the man, namely, who pleases Him He has given the wisdom and shrewdness to enjoy himself; and to him who displeases, He has given the urge to gather and amass\u2014only for handing on to one who is pleasing to God. That too is futile and pursuit of wind.

VI have observed the business that God gave man to be concerned with:
p20965
sI11
VHe brings everything to pass precisely at its time; He also puts eternity in their mind, but without man ever guessing, from first to last, all the things that God brings to pass.
p20966

VThus I realized that the only worthwhile thing there is for them is to enjoy themselves and do what is good in their lifetime;
p20967

Valso, that whenever a man does eat and drink and get enjoyment out of all his wealth, it is a gift of God.
p20968
sI14
VI realized, too, that whatever God has brought to pass will recur evermore:Nothing can be added to itAnd nothing taken from it\u2014and God has brought to pass that men revere Him.
p20969
sI15
VWhat is occurring occurred long since,And what is to occur occurred long since:and God seeks the pursued.

VAnd, indeed, I have observed under the sun:Alongside justice there is wickedness,Alongside righteousness there is wickedness.

VI mused: \u201cGod will doom both righteous and wicked, for there is a time for every experience and for every happening.\u201d

VSo I decided, as regards men, to dissociate them [from] the divine beings and to face the fact that they are beasts.
p20973

VFor in respect of the fate of man and the fate of beast, they have one and the same fate: as the one dies so dies the other, and both have the same lifebreath; man has no superiority over beast, since both amount to nothing.

Vthe case of the man who is alone, with no companion, who has neither son nor brother; yet he amasses wealth without limit, and his eye is never sated with riches. For whom, now, is he amassing it while denying himself enjoyment? That too is a futility and an unhappy business.

VThe satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the royal companions gathered around to look at those men, on whose bodies the fire had had no effect, the hair of whose heads had not been singed, whose shirts looked no different, to whom not even the odor of fire clung.

VNebuchadnezzar spoke up and said, \u201cBlessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who sent His angel to save His servants who, trusting in Him, flouted the king\u2019s decree at the risk of their lives rather than serve or worship any god but their own God.
p21426
sI29
VI hereby give an order that [anyone of] any people or nation of whatever language who blasphemes the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego shall be torn limb from limb, and his house confiscated, for there is no other God who is able to save in this way.\u201d

VI, Nebuchadnezzar, was living serenely in my house, flourishing in my palace.
p21433
sI2
VI had a dream that frightened me, and my thoughts in bed and the vision of my mind alarmed me.
p21434
sI3
VI gave an order to bring all the wise men of Babylon before me to let me know the meaning of the dream.
p21435
sI4
VThe magicians, exorcists, Chaldeans, and diviners came, and I related the dream to them, but they could not make its meaning known to me.
p21436
sI5
VFinally, Daniel, called Belteshazzar after the name of my god, in whom the spirit of the holy gods was, came to me, and I related the dream to him, [saying],
p21437
sI6
V\u201cBelteshazzar, chief magician, in whom I know the spirit of the holy gods to be, and whom no mystery baffles, tell me the meaning of my dream vision that I have seen.

VIn the visions of my mind in bedI saw a tree of great height in the midst of the earth;
p21439
sI8
VThe tree grew and became mighty;Its top reached heaven,
p21440
sI9
VAnd it was visible to the ends of the earth.Its foliage was beautifulAnd its fruit abundant;There was food for all in it.Beneath it the beasts of the field found shade,And the birds of the sky dwelt on its branches;All creatures fed on it.
p21441
sI10
VIn the vision of my mind in bed, I looked and saw a holy Watcher coming down from heaven.
p21442
sI11
VHe called loudly and said:\u2018Hew down the tree, lop off its branches,Strip off its foliage, scatter its fruit.Let the beasts of the field flee from beneath itAnd the birds from its branches,
p21443
sI12
VBut leave the stump with its roots in the ground.In fetters of iron and bronzeIn the grass of the field,Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven,And share earth\u2019s verdure with the beasts.
p21444
sI13
VLet his mind be altered from that of a man,And let him be given the mind of a beast,And let seven seasons pass over him.
p21445
sI14
VThis sentence is decreed by the Watchers;This verdict is commanded by the Holy OnesSo that all creatures may knowThat the Most High is sovereign over the realm of man,And He gives it to whom He wishesAnd He may set over it even the lowest of men.\u2019
p21446
sI15
V\u201cI, King Nebuchadnezzar, had this dream; now you, Belteshazzar, tell me its meaning, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make its meaning known to me, but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.\u201d
p21447
sI16
VThen Daniel, called Belteshazzar, was perplexed for a while, and alarmed by his thoughts. The king addressed him, \u201cLet the dream and its meaning not alarm you.\u201d Belteshazzar replied, \u201cMy lord, would that the dream were for your enemy and its meaning for your foe!

VYou will be driven away from men and have your habitation with the beasts of the field. You will be fed grass like cattle, and be drenched with the dew of heaven; seven seasons will pass over you until you come to know that the Most High is sovereign over the realm of man, and He gives it to whom He wishes.
p21454
sI23
VAnd the meaning of the command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots is that the kingdom will remain yours from the time you come to know that Heaven is sovereign.
p21455
sI24
VTherefore, O king, may my advice be acceptable to you: Redeem your sins by beneficence and your iniquities by generosity to the poor; then your serenity may be extended.\u201d

VYou are being driven away from men, and your habitation is to be with the beasts of the field. You are to be fed grass like cattle, and seven seasons will pass over you until you come to know that the Most High is sovereign over the realm of man and He gives it to whom He wishes.\u201d
p21461
sI30
VThere and then the sentence was carried out upon Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven away from men, he ate grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like eagle\u2019s [feathers] and his nails like [the talons of] birds.
p21462
sI31
V\u201cWhen the time had passed, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason was restored to me. I blessed the Most High, and praised and glorified the Ever-Living One,Whose dominion is an everlasting dominionAnd whose kingdom endures throughout the generations.

sI20
VBut when he grew haughty and willfully presumptuous, he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was removed from him.
p21487

VHe was driven away from men, and his mind made like that of a beast, and his habitation was with wild asses. He was fed grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he came to know that the Most High God is sovereign over the realm of man, and sets over it whom He wishes.
p21488
sI22
VBut you, Belshazzar his son, did not humble yourself although you knew all this.
p21489
sI23
VYou exalted yourself against the Lord of Heaven, and had the vessels of His temple brought to you. You and your nobles, your consorts, and your concubines drank wine from them and praised the gods of silver and gold, bronze and iron, wood and stone, which do not see, hear, or understand; but the God who controls your lifebreath and every move you make\u2014Him you did not glorify!

Vover them were three ministers, one of them Daniel, to whom these satraps reported, in order that the king not be troubled.

VThis man Daniel surpassed the other ministers and satraps by virtue of his extraordinary spirit, and the king considered setting him over the whole kingdom.

VThe ministers and satraps looked for some fault in Daniel\u2019s conduct in matters of state, but they could find neither fault nor corruption, inasmuch as he was trustworthy, and no negligence or corruption was to be found in him.

p21507

VThereupon King Darius put the ban in writing.
p21508
sI11
VWhen Daniel learned that it had been put in writing, he went to his house, in whose upper chamber he had had windows made facing Jerusalem, and three times a day he knelt down, prayed, and made confession to his God, as he had always done.
p21509
sI12
VThen those men came thronging in and found Daniel petitioning his God in supplication.
p21510
sI13
VThey then approached the king and reminded him of the royal ban: \u201cDid you not put in writing a ban that whoever addresses a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, during the next thirty days, shall be thrown into a lions\u2019 den?\u201d The king said in reply, \u201cThe order stands firm, as a law of the Medes and Persians that may not be abrogated.\u201d
p21511
sI14
VThereupon they said to the king, \u201cDaniel, one of the exiles of Judah, pays no heed to you, O king, or to the ban that you put in writing; three times a day he offers his petitions [to his God].\u201d
p21512
sI15
VUpon hearing that, the king was very disturbed, and he set his heart upon saving Daniel, and until the sun set made every effort to rescue him.
p21513

p21514
sI17
VBy the king\u2019s order, Daniel was then brought and thrown into the lions\u2019 den. The king spoke to Daniel and said, \u201cYour God, whom you serve so regularly, will deliver you.\u201d
p21515
sI18
VA rock was brought and placed over the mouth of the den; the king sealed it with his signet and with the signet of his nobles, so that nothing might be altered concerning Daniel.

VThen, at the first light of dawn, the king arose and rushed to the lions\u2019 den.
p21518

VAs he approached the den, he cried to Daniel in a mournful voice; the king said to Daniel, \u201cDaniel, servant of the living God, was the God whom you served so regularly able to deliver you from the lions?\u201d

VDaniel then talked with the king, \u201cO king, live forever!

VThe king was very glad, and ordered Daniel to be brought up out of the den. Daniel was brought up out of the den, and no injury was found on him, for he had trusted in his God.
p21522
sI25
VThen, by order of the king, those men who had slandered Daniel were brought and, together with their children and wives, were thrown into the lions\u2019 den. They had hardly reached the bottom of the den when the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.
p21523
sI26
VThen King Darius wrote to all peoples and nations of every language that inhabit the earth, \u201cMay your well-being abound!
p21524
sI27
VI have hereby given an order that throughout my royal domain men must tremble in fear before the God of Daniel, for He is the living God who endures forever; His kingdom is indestructible, and His dominion is to the end of time;

VHe delivers and saves, and performs signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, for He delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.\u201d

VIn the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and a vision of his mind in bed; afterward he wrote down the dream. Beginning the account,
p21529
sI2
VDaniel related the following:\u201cIn my vision at night, I saw the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea.
p21530
sI3
VFour mighty beasts different from each other emerged from the sea.
p21531
sI4
VThe first was like a lion but had eagles\u2019 wings. As I looked on, its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted off the ground and set on its feet like a man and given the mind of a man.
p21532
sI5
VThen I saw a second, different beast, which was like a bear but raised on one side, and with three fangs in its mouth among its teeth; it was told, \u2018Arise, eat much meat!\u2019
p21533
sI6
VAfter that, as I looked on, there was another one, like a leopard, and it had on its back four wings like those of a bird; the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it.
p21534
sI7
VAfter that, as I looked on in the night vision, there was a fourth beast\u2014fearsome, dreadful, and very powerful, with great iron teeth\u2014that devoured and crushed, and stamped the remains with its feet. It was different from all the other beasts which had gone before it; and it had ten horns.
p21535
sI8
VWhile I was gazing upon these horns, a new little horn sprouted up among them; three of the older horns were uprooted to make room for it. There were eyes in this horn like those of a man, and a mouth that spoke arrogantly.
p21536
sI9
VAs I looked on,Thrones were set in place,And the Ancient of Days took His seat.His garment was like white snow,And the hair of His head was like lamb\u2019s wool.His throne was tongues of flame;Its wheels were blazing fire.
p21537
sI10
VA river of fire streamed forth before Him;Thousands upon thousands served Him;Myriads upon myriads attended Him;The court sat and the books were opened.
p21538
sI11
VI looked on. Then, because of the arrogant words that the horn spoke, the beast was killed as I looked on; its body was destroyed and it was consigned to the flames.
p21539
sI12
VThe dominion of the other beasts was taken away, but an extension of life was given to them for a time and season.
p21540
sI13
VAs I looked on, in the night vision,One like a human beingCame with the clouds of heaven;He reached the Ancient of DaysAnd was presented to Him.
p21541
sI14
VDominion, glory, and kingship were given to him;All peoples and nations of every language must serve him.His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not pass away,And his kingship, one that shall not be destroyed.
p21542
sI15
VAs for me, Daniel, my spirit was disturbed within me and the vision of my mind alarmed me.
p21543
sI16
VI approached one of the attendants and asked him the true meaning of all this. He gave me this interpretation of the matter:
p21544
sI17
V\u2018 These great beasts, four in number [mean] four kingdoms will arise out of the earth;
p21545
sI18
Vthen holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and will possess the kingdom forever\u2014forever and ever.\u2019
p21546
sI19
VThen I wanted to ascertain the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from them all, very fearsome, with teeth of iron, claws of bronze, that devoured and crushed, and stamped the remains;
p21547
sI20
Vand of the ten horns on its head; and of the new one that sprouted, to make room for which three fell\u2014the horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke arrogantly, and which was more conspicuous than its fellows.
p21548
sI21
V(I looked on as that horn made war with the holy ones and overcame them,
p21549
sI22
Vuntil the Ancient of Days came and judgment was rendered in favor of the holy ones of the Most High, for the time had come, and the holy ones took possession of the kingdom.)
p21550
sI23
VThis is what he said: \u2018The fourth beast [means]\u2014there will be a fourth kingdom upon the earth which will be different from all the kingdoms; it will devour the whole earth, tread it down, and crush it.
p21551
sI24
VAnd the ten horns [mean]\u2014from that kingdom, ten kings will arise, and after them another will arise. He will be different from the former ones, and will bring low three kings.
p21552
sI25
VHe will speak words against the Most High, and will harass the holy ones of the Most High. He will think of changing times and laws, and they will be delivered into his power for a time, times, and half a time.
p21553
sI26
VThen the court will sit and his dominion will be taken away, to be destroyed and abolished for all time.
p21554
sI27
VThe kingship and dominion and grandeur belonging to all the kingdoms under Heaven will be given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High. Their kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.\u2019 \ufeff\u201d

VIn the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, to me, Daniel, after the one that had appeared to me earlier.
p21558
sI2
VI saw in the vision\u2014at the time I saw it I was in the fortress of Shushan, in the province of Elam\u2014I saw in the vision that I was beside the Ulai River.
p21559
sI3
VI looked and saw a ram standing between me and the river; he had two horns; the horns were high, with one higher than the other, and the higher sprouting last.
p21560
sI4
VI saw the ram butting westward, northward, and southward. No beast could withstand him, and there was none to deliver from his power. He did as he pleased and grew great.
p21561
sI5
VAs I looked on, a he-goat came from the west, passing over the entire earth without touching the ground. The goat had a conspicuous horn on its forehead.
p21562
sI6
VHe came up to the two-horned ram that I had seen standing between me and the river and charged at him with furious force.
p21563
sI7
VI saw him reach the ram and rage at him; he struck the ram and broke its two horns, and the ram was powerless to withstand him. He threw him to the ground and trampled him, and there was none to deliver the ram from his power.
p21564
sI8
VThen the he-goat grew very great, but at the peak of his power his big horn was broken. In its place, four conspicuous horns sprouted toward the four winds of heaven.
p21565
sI9
VFrom one of them emerged a small horn, which extended itself greatly toward the south, toward the east, and toward the beautiful land.
p21566
sI10
VIt grew as high as the host of heaven and it hurled some stars of the [heavenly] host to the ground and trampled them.
p21567
sI11
VIt vaunted itself against the very chief of the host; on its account the regular offering was suspended, and His holy place was abandoned.
p21568
sI12
VAn army was arrayed iniquitously against the regular offering; it hurled truth to the ground and prospered in what it did.
p21569
sI13
VThen I heard a holy being speaking, and another holy being said to whoever it was who was speaking, \u201cHow long will [what was seen in] the vision last\u2014the regular offering be forsaken because of transgression; the sanctuary be surrendered and the [heavenly] host be trampled?\u201d
p21570

V\u201cBut now, for a short while, there has been a reprieve from the Lord our God, who has granted us a surviving remnant and given us a stake in His holy place; our God has restored the luster to our eyes and furnished us with a little sustenance in our bondage.

VWhen Sanballat and Tobiah, and the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that healing had come to the walls of Jerusalem, that the breached parts had begun to be filled, it angered them very much,
p22063
sI2
Vand they all conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to throw it into confusion.

VBecause of them we prayed to our God, and set up a watch over them day and night.

VJudah was saying,\u201cThe strength of the basket-carrier has failed,And there is so much rubble;We are not able ourselvesTo rebuild the wall.\u201d
p22066

VWhen the Jews living near them would arrive, they would tell us time and again \u201c... from all the places where ... you shall come back to us...\ufeff.\u201d

VI stationed, on the lower levels of the place, behind the walls, on the bare rock\u2014I stationed the people by families with their swords, their lances, and their bows.
p22069
sI8
VThen I decided to exhort the nobles, the prefects, and the rest of the people, \u201cDo not be afraid of them! Think of the great and awesome Lord, and fight for your brothers, your sons and daughters, your wives and homes!\u201d
p22070
sI9
VWhen our enemies learned that it had become known to us, since God had thus frustrated their plan, we could all return to the wall, each to his work.
p22071
sI10
VFrom that day on, half my servants did work and half held lances and shields, bows and armor. And the officers stood behind the whole house of Judah
p22072
sI11
Vwho were rebuilding the wall. The basket-carriers were burdened, doing work with one hand while the other held a weapon.
p22073
sI12
VAs for the builders, each had his sword girded at his side as he was building. The trumpeter stood beside me.
p22074
sI13
VI said to the nobles, the prefects, and the rest of the people, \u201cThere is much work and it is spread out; we are scattered over the wall, far from one another.
p22075
sI14
VWhen you hear a trumpet call, gather yourselves to me at that place; our God will fight for us!\u201d
p22076
sI15
VAnd so we worked on, while half were holding lances, from the break of day until the stars appeared.
p22077
sI16
VI further said to the people at that time, \u201cLet every man with his servant lodge in Jerusalem, that we may use the night to stand guard and the day to work.\u201d

VSome said, \u201cOur sons and daughters are numerous; we must get grain to eat in order that we may live!\u201d
p22082
sI3
VOthers said, \u201cWe must pawn our fields, our vineyards, and our homes to get grain to stave off hunger.\u201d
p22083

VYet others said, \u201cWe have borrowed money against our fields and vineyards to pay the king\u2019s tax.
p22084
sI5
VNow we are as good as our brothers, and our children as good as theirs; yet here we are subjecting our sons and daughters to slavery\u2014some of our daughters are already subjected\u2014and we are powerless, while our fields and vineyards belong to others.\u201d
p22085
sI6
VIt angered me very much to hear their outcry and these complaints.
p22086
sI7
VAfter pondering the matter carefully, I censured the nobles and the prefects, saying, \u201cAre you pressing claims on loans made to your brothers?\u201d Then I raised a large crowd against them
p22087
sI8
Vand said to them, \u201cWe have done our best to buy back our Jewish brothers who were sold to the nations; will you now sell your brothers so that they must be sold [back] to us?\u201d They kept silent, for they found nothing to answer.
p22088
sI9
VSo I continued, \u201cWhat you are doing is not right. You ought to act in a God-fearing way so as not to give our enemies, the nations, room to reproach us.
p22089
sI10
VI, my brothers, and my servants also have claims of money and grain against them; let us now abandon those claims!
p22090
sI11
VGive back at once their fields, their vineyards, their olive trees, and their homes, and [abandon] the claims for the hundred pieces of silver, the grain, the wine, and the oil that you have been pressing against them!\u201d
p22091
sI12
VThey replied, \u201cWe shall give them back, and not demand anything of them; we shall do just as you say.\u201d Summoning the priests, I put them under oath to keep this promise.
p22092
sI13
VI also shook out the bosom of my garment and said, \u201cSo may God shake free of his household and property any man who fails to keep this promise; may he be thus shaken out and stripped.\u201d All the assembled answered, \u201cAmen,\u201d and praised the Lord.The people kept this promise.

VFurthermore, from the day I was commissioned to be governor in the land of Judah\u2014from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes until his thirty-second year, twelve years in all\u2014neither I nor my brothers ever ate of the governor\u2019s food allowance.
p22094
sI15
VThe former governors who preceded me laid heavy burdens on the people, and took from them for bread and wine more than forty shekels of silver. Their servants also tyrannized over the people. But I, out of the fear of God, did not do so.
p22095
sI16
VI also supported the work on this wall; we did not buy any land, and all my servants were gathered there at the work.
p22096
sI17
VAlthough there were at my table, between Jews and prefects, one hundred and fifty men in all, beside those who came to us from surrounding nations;
p22097
sI18
Vand although what was prepared for each day came to one ox, six select sheep, and fowl, all prepared for me, and at ten-day intervals all sorts of wine in abundance\u2014yet I did not resort to the governor\u2019s food allowance, for the [king\u2019s] service lay heavily on the people.

VRefusing to obey, unmindful of Your wonders that You did for them, they stiffened their necks, and in their defiance resolved to return to their slavery. But You, being a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, long-suffering and abounding in faithfulness, did not abandon them.

VBut when they had relief, they again did what was evil in Your sight, so You abandoned them to the power of their enemies, who subjugated them. Again they cried to You, and You in heaven heard and rescued them in Your compassion, time after time.

VYou admonished them in order to turn them back to Your Teaching, but they acted presumptuously and disobeyed Your commandments, and sinned against Your rules, by following which a man shall live. They turned a defiant shoulder, stiffened their neck, and would not obey.
